Depending in circunstances like Spriggans are resident of a lugubrious, cursed or melancholic places, some becomes inbued in bad vibes and start becoming poisonous. Unlike Spriggans that are keepers of the nature and have connection with spirits, Mandragoras instead become passively hostile, lurking intruders that are unfortunate to be considered its pray. While Mandragora are still loyal to what they used to consider their friends, still they're friends of no-one anymore because of their selfish behavior and because of being incable to incorporate to the yokai ecosystem, even if still being considered part of it by both foreign and yokai."
