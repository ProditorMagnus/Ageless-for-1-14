    description= _"The Deep Elves live in a place called the Underearth, that is located in the realms of the far east, a land, where both sun and moon never set and day equals night. The Underearth is a huge earthly dome within the depths of the far east. Its vastness has often lead people to saying that the Underearth itself is an own world. Lonesome wanderers often report about seeing wandering stars inside the caves of the Underearth, but what do they know about a place, where the sky's the earth?
		
		The beings living inside these darkest depths are of elvish origin, yet their prolonged exposure to the darkness led to various adaptations: while some adapted to the darkness, becoming the shadows themselves, the body of a few former elves resisted against the influence of the darkness, which resulted in them emerging light.
		
		The elves that once descended into the depths had lost their faith in nature, believing that nature is just as influenced by the great things beyond as the elves themselves. Searching for exactly these things beyond, the ancestors of the Deep Elves discovered the works and scriptures of an ancient perished civilisation. Great vaults built by the Deep Elves are since then gracing the darkest depths, inside are shrines of Shassagoth - a being described in those scriptures and whose return they are awaiting."
