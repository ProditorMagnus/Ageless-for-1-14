    description= {AE_DEP_UNIT_NOTICE} +  _ "Minotaurs roam the eastern plains of the Great Continent and are innate friendly beings, only showing aggressive behaviour once defending the realms of their kin. When the light of the sun shines onto them, these eastern Minotaurs turn into a bulwark of stone, leading to plains of apparent monoliths gracing the vastness. This is due to a curse that has been lead upon them. The AE_dep_deep elves, however, invited the Minotaurs into the dark caverns of the Underearth, where they smithed a pact. The cursed Minotaurs would be granted access to the upper caves, yet they'd have to pledge allegiance to Shassagoth, the heart of the depths. The AE_dep_deep elves use this for their advantage and force the minotaurs to fight at the front, often easily piercing through enemy lines."
