    description= _ "This unit is from the Steelhive faction. Its coding and art were done by Zerovirus and melinath.
 
The Mirages are excellent reflectors of heat and cold, making them highly resistant to magical and energy attacks. Be wary!
Unlike lightshifters, mirages are capable of ZoC which is a enormous tactical advantage compared to the previously mentioned lightshifters.

But are somewhat highly vulnerable to physical attacks, especially to impact type.
With improved light ray, it can do extra harm the more times it hits the same objective and now is more accurate against nimble targets.

This unit counts with an exotic and unique feature of 20% ressistance to secret, which is highest base value in all Ageless"
