    description= _ "This unit is from the Dark Legion faction. Its coding and art were done by Aethaeryn and  Neoskel.

Swords are, for many, an expensive luxury, and one which peasants can ill afford. Spears are much easier to make and will do well even without a spearhead, though most can afford one. Clad in leather armor, and often armed with a shield and a few javelins, spearmen are the staple of most armies, often thrown into the front lines with only the most basic training."
