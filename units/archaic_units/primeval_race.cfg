    description= _ "The race of men is an extremely diverse one. Some of them bow and scrape before their wealthy, blue-blooded, leaders, while others turn to a life of crime.  Then there are those who fall prey to the promises of false hope and false saviours, or are just searching for a stronger power to overthrow the current world order.  The revived Primeval Gods, and their messangers, provide this last group with the resources and opportunity to strike back at the Kingdoms, Tribes, and Guilds with which they are so disgusted.  Thus armed and organized, these rebels are the disposable front-line forces of the Primeval Legion."

<header>text='History'</header>
In their time, they were engaged in an exceptionally grim war with an enemy both powerful and mysterious.  The enemy was defeated, but the devastation to the world was severe and many Primeval leaders decided it best to go into a form of suspended animation.

Ages later, the Primevals re-emerged and encountered the modern races.  All differences might have been overcome, but approximately 50 years after the Primeval re-emergance came a plage.

A strange disease of the soul and mind broke out, and denizens of the world became something else - something that called itself Khthon.  As all other races fell victim to the Khthon, the Primevals rose in strength, for they were immune.  In the ensueing war against the Khthon, the Primevals developed a distrust and hatred of all other races, for any of their member could be Khthon infiltrator.

Records of how the war was resolved are lost, but ultimately we know it was the younger races who had triumphed.  Many of the Primevals had foreseen this, and had once again gone into suspended animation within their aging facilities.

<header>text='Technology'</header>
The Primevals had never really mastered magic to the extent that the modern races have.  However, they did figure ways to harness it for a power source, and were able to easily mine and forge metals, fertilizers, and reactive chemicals; resources were unlimited.  Many of the modern races would have simply enjoyed a population explosion, but the austere Primeval culture led to something else.  Many feats of engineering were the result.  The downside of the rapid development was that the technological advances were uneven (roads, guns, aeroplanes, and many other things had simply never been imagined) and they all rested upon a power source no one understood:  that which some call 'magic'.

<header>text='Society'</header>
The Primeval social order is very rigid, but merit-based.  The leaders are near god-like in their physical strength and prowess, but do not simply rule through a strong arm and stone heart.  Treachery to another Primeval is one of the most dishonourable acts one can engage in, so while all subordinates look upon their superiors with fear, they know those superiors have earned their rank and will neither betray nor toy with them.  The result is a disciplined and efficient military force, but the society lacks creativity and can become too focussed upon narrow goals.

As a result of both the rigid meritocracy and the abundance of resources, the Primevals lost whatever ideas about gender roles they once had.  In general, the roles requiring strength fall to the males while roles requiring endurance fall to the females, but either sex can become a leader and both sexes are expected to engage in combat."
