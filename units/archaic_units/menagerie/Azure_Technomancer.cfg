Azure Technomancer people cannot be considered anymore as human or living being at all, neither as undead or machine... just as an aproximation of a living mechanical undead. Combining arts of necromancy with deep knowledges of anatomy and mechanical engineering this being has not lost its previous human conscience, being remarkable that somehow is the same being in other type of body.

Such job can only be done by very brillant but really twisted geniuses that dominate either arts of necromancy, enginering, and anatomy and being that cold minded to attempt such process in their own body. Most organs were remplaced by mechanical parts that with help of necromancy does complete their organic counterparts functions... organs that depending the technmancers variates, but any technomancer system by rule works by blood running these semi/mechanical complex.

These bodies have various advantages compared to human body, most remarkable of them is being inmune to poison and being physically toughter and stronger than almost any human. These bodies can be easily repaired by even a trustworhy amateur mechanic and isn't highly vulnerable to arcane or holy pressence. Body that can be nearly inmortal unless someone attempts to finish the life of a Technomancer but time is no problem to this mechanical living undead body.

Even most talented magicians of the age, magical beings or or even ancient races doesn't even imagine how this is really possible but aren't either interested about learning about replicating such thing. Just showing us that some type of knowledge is just unique and unrepeatable.

Limitations of this body is that is completly neutral to magic regardless of any type of treatment you try, and that once taken the decision to try such process can no longer canalyze any kind of magic efficiently even if isn't costs much to you, but regardless of the effort into it, the result is nearly the same no matter how talented or prodigious you were before the result is constant, predictible and limited due of the complicated body system always preffers to maintain itself stable."
