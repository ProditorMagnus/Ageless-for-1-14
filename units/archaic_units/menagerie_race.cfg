These intrepid explorers and diligent researchers reached for the stars, and were rewarded for their efforts for many generations.  This accomplishment hit a sour note, however, when the Magnellian explorers encountered a rogue planet covered with archaic ruins.

Though they didn't know it at the time, the Magnellians had stumbled across the Destroyer; a malevolent force that lurks in the space between worlds and ensures no civilization can spread across the universe.  It took many decades, but the Magnellian civilization eventually fell to this new enemy.  The elements that still function are thralls to the Destroyer."

    description= _ "The Magnellian civilization reached great heights and enlightenment, despite some flaws.  They dared to reach out and touch the stars, and the first alien civilization they encountered was a race of bald, bug-eyed, rubbery dwarves, who seemed to lack any gender or emotion.  Yet they must have some emotion, for once the two peoples could communicate, the Magnellians couldn't help but detect a hint of good humor when the rubbery dwarves explained that they were 'Roswell Greys'.  The Magnellians had no idea what that meant, but the name stuck, and the 'little green men' were hence known as 'Roswellians'

Outerspace is vast, empty, and dangerous, so the Roswellian and Magnellian civilizations did not assimilate quickly.  When the Magnellians stumbled across the Destroyer, and were subsumed into the terrible force of destruction that keeps the universe free of galactic empires, the Roswellians had but a small outpost exposed.  A handful of Roswellian workers and soldiers were swept up in the enslavement of the Magnellians, but the rest of their civilization was able to sever ties and flee the trap of the Destroyer."
