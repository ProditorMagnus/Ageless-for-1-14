    description={AE_ARC_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"The Shoremen are responsible for loading ships and breaking down retired vessals to reclaim the components. Almost all of this work involves ropes, so the Shoremen are very skilled with this simple tool and can tie down even moving animals. A spike is very helpful in making splices, as well as killing rats."
