# this is a unit sort of like walking corpse (<-what?).  It looks like a higher level unit,
# but has no z.o.c. and dies when hit (attacker should not get XP), cannot advance.
# Probably best to use [base_unit], so the graphics are the same as the real one.
# Actually, it can advance.  The coloured XP stats was too much of a give-away.
# But it dies so easily, I can't imagine anyone actually getting it to advance.

        #       The broken ellipse is too big a give-away, so these things will have a zoc, even if it overpowers them.  This will hopefully change in the future.
