    description={AE_ARC_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"Seals are less attuned to human interaction than are dogs, but they can be trained, and are better at swimming in the deep, cold water often encountered in the north. The Ukians also use tame seals to trick the wild seals they sometimes hunt, which doesn't seem to bother the tame seals."
