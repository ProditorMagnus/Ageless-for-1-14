    description={AE_EFM_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Whether through inheritance or by rising through the ranks a merchant lord is a wealthy man who finances and organizes trading expeditions through the sea states and probably owns land. Due to the nature of politics in the sea states, each merchant lord will have a private army on contract and most have no qualms about using it to gain money in less than legitimate ways. Many merchant lords are former warriors themselves who earned position in various guilds and who are quite a force on the battlefield personally."
