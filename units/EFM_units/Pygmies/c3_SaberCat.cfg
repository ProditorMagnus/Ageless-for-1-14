    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
Many lynxes are content to enjoy the position they have fought for but many still compete with the rest for even more renown within their caste. The ones who are considered serious competitors are called saber cats after the legendary hunters. Incidentally, most of these pygmies are strong enough to wield full sized sabers."
