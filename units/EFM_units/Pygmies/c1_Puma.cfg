    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
The Pygmies export spider silk and a number of other things to the sea states in exchange for tools and steel knives. A long knife may as well be a sword in the hands of a pygmy but others have learned not to underestimate the agility with which the little men can wield their weapons. In particular their ability to dart around a mans guard is noted."
