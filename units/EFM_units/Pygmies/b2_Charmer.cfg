    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
A famous trick that originated among the pygmies is the ability to charm snakes. Ironically this ability requires no magic at all and can be practiced by any brave man. It is said however that you should not anger the snake charmer that carries a pygmy flute for even if no snake approaches you, you may find yourself with a poisoned bite in an uncomfortable place."
