    description={AE_EFM_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Among the dalesfolk are those who study the theory of magic. Through careful experimentation they have discovered a devastatingly deadly way to attack with it. By touching something or someone they can channel its heat directly into the ground. Though there are many peaceful applications for such magicians the most famous use of it was in a siege where a group of them made the base of a stone wall so brittle that the wall could be smashed through with a hammer."
