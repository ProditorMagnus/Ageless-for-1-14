    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Four Moons. Its coding was done by Velensk and art by L. Shelby.
There is a special knack to channeling that will allow it to be done at a distance. It takes constant practice and conditioning to do it for any real amount of energy so most channelers don't bother. The rare few who specialize in it are of great use in a few industries."
