    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Nearly at the top of the Tri-Point Council are the High Council Members. All members of the High Council are undoubtably some of the most skilled of their generation, in both the use of a trident as well as in politics. These overlords take on a great weight of responsibility when they are given their first real chance to prove their true leadership capabilites for they are given a small lake town or ocean village to reign over. To both lead their armies in times of war, and lead them to prosper in times of peace."
