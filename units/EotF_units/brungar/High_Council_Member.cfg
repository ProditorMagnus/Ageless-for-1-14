Nearly at the top of the Tri-Point Council are the High Council Members. All members of the High Council are undoubtably some of the most skilled of their generation, in both the use of a trident as well as in politics. These overlords take on a great weight of responsibility when they are given their first real chance to prove their true leadership capabilites for they are given a small lake town or ocean village to reign over. To both lead their armies in times of war, and lead them to prosper in times of peace."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
