    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
The mounted heads of a myriad of creatures, from sea serpents to orc chieftains, adorn the walls of the abodes of the most experienced harpooniers. In their decades of service, they have faced the most dreaded foes and brought them down with the impressive power of their weapons. These have been customized to the point where only their owners knows how to maintain and use them, finely tuned for the best possible performance. To the young Brungar, the Big Game Hunters are like figures of legend - their aim supernatural, their trophy-adorned armor awe-inspiring, even the simple act of carrying their colossal guns a heroic feat on its own."
