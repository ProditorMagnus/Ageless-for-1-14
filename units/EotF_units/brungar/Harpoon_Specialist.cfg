    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
Nobody can teach you to use the heavy and fickle harpoon gun to its full potential - it is an acquired skill that takes years to master. The Harpoon Specialists are elite Harpooniers, the creme de la creme; few can discern the effects of currents and the target's movements on the shot better.
Each is also a tinkerer in his own right, modifying his weapon for greater reliability, accuracy and power whenever he can; the veterans trade improvement tricks like a valuable commodity.
Meanwhile, the foes of the Brungar have learnt to fear the view of rows of large-bore muzzles pointed their way - at least those who have had the opportunity to learn from their mistakes."
