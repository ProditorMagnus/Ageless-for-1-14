The rank of High Council Elder is without doubt the pinnacle achievement of any Brungar's lifetime, for the task of even being considered for this post is a laborious and time consuming process. Their deeds in battle are unfathomable and are often great lords who are given the task of looking over great sections of the king's domain. Their armor and great trident are made from the strongest metal found in their seas and tinted red to make their presence on the battlefield easily discovered and to spread fear throughout the enemy ranks. Although they are usually higher in age then the members of the lower rings of the council, they are still great sturdy Brungar whose leadership capabilities are exceeded by none."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
