Those who advance to the rank of Wave Masters are true masters of their environment, and as such, they can summon huge waves that can crush their opponents simply by the sheer wieght of the water. They owe much of their success to the one who discovered the benefits of place water runes on paddles. For with the use of these runic paddles they can manipulate the waves almost with ease. And to keep from crushing themselves with their own waves, the Wave Master continues to use his harpoon if an enemy gets to close."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
