The Brungar use an unknown magic to haste the growth of the crabs into beasts of destruction; upon the complete growth of such a behemoth, the army uses it for defense and hunting. These titanic arthropods are often used as living siege engines in wartime, capable of cleaving through an army of enemies without so much of a scratch due to their natural armor. Their skill in using water blasts has become as deadly as the most accurate elven snipers."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BEACHHOME}
