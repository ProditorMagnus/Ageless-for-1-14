    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Most ancient creatures are eldritch horrors, ancient antediluvians, the culminations of legends. Monsters that stalk the night. Behemoths whom no sane being has ever encountered, and survived mentally intact to relate his story. Avatars of destruction, older than time itself, living only for the chaos it creates. Mysterious creatures whose origins and motivations are alike unknown. The Leviathan is not any one of the above categories. Leviathans, despite their imposing size, power, and name, are quite a gentle and trustworthy caste of turtles. The Brungar tamers that are held responsible for maintaining the creature's health understand, and know, the build and mindset of the creature, from each scratch of the Leviathan's imposing, nigh-impenetrable shell to all of its ancient, slow considerations floating through its cranium. The Leviathans are always the focal point of work in the Brungar culture, only the best of food, purified water, herbal accelerators of growth, and other consumables go toward these treasured war machines. Indeed, the newest tenders of the Leviathans find that the creatures, though majestic, are something of a thousand-ton bother in the subjects of hygiene and clinical need. Leviathans, though extremely difficult to care for due to their size, are deadly on the battlefield, as one would probably expect from a siege engine of their size. Their flippers, though admittedly not of much use propelling them on land, can shatter the strongest of fortifications with one sweeping blow, the armored plates that compose its shell can withstand the strongest of physical and magical attacks. They are a sight to be feared by all who would dare to stand in the path of such a behemoth. The creature, when at sea, is easily mistaken for an island, this attribute gives them a useful advantage in stealth, for they have been known to ferry thousands of their stout masters across an unforgiving sea, to vanquish all enemies before them."
