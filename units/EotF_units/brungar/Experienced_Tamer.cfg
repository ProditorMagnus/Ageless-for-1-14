    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

After they have managed to capture, tame, and train a fierce creature to fight beside them, Amateur Tamers are called Experienced Tamers, for as their name says, they are experienced. They can put their training to the test and set out to conquer the creatures of legend that caused many to join their ranks. The glory of capturing mighty beasts is looked down upon by none, and great rewards and honors are bestowed upon those that manage to do so."
