Sea Turtles are a necessity of life for the sea-faring Brungar. Although the majority of these docile reptiles are kept for food, it occassionally happens that one of the oceanic testudines become a warsteed. These animals join the Brungar army as what amounts to their adolescence. Their shells are immediately painted according to the tribal color of their tamers, in order to discern them from wild and enemy turtles. The bony shell of these turtles are comparable in fortitude to the guardsmen of ancient times. The turtles will bite antagonizing forces in close range, and can fire jets of water at enemies when engaging in long-range combat."
