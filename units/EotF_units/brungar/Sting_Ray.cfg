    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Training a stingray to be of any use in battle is a challenging, and dangerous, task. However, it is very rewarding if it is completed. The stingray is one of the the most deadly creatures in the Brungar's arsenal if fought in the water, since they can often not only out-manuever their opponents, but are quite strong with the use of their natural poisonous stinger. Although the Herbicidiers could use Sting Ray posion in their vile concoctions, the death toll of those extracting the venom was catastrophicly higher then those that they used the poison on. Needless to say, the Sting Rays are a force to be reckoned with, and are never truly tame."
