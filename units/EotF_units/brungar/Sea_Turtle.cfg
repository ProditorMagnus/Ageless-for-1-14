    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

These turtles, full grown and capable of decapitating a small human in one bite, have proven themselves in battle. The same magics used to accelerate the growth of the crabs are also used on these reptiles, growing them until they are easily mistaken for buildings. This is seen as the peak of achievement by the turtles, and all who achieve this honor become the most vigilant guardians of the Brungar."
