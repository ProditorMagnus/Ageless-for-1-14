    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Some Ocean Apprentices choose to go a different path. The Ice Apprentices are the more militant of their fellow mages, since they make the water into a weapon by freezing and then sharpening the ice until it is as deadly as most metallic weapons. However, many who oppose the Ice Apprentice don't realize the skill involved in making their weapons for before they can take a gander as to what is being done, spikes of ice are impaling their bodies. Only the incredibly fleet of foot and mind can avoid their deadly weapons, and even they have trouble doing so for very long."
