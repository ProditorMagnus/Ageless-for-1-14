    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

The Brungar use their skill in taming by growing the crab to abnormal sizes. These crabs have begun to exceed the norm size of their cousins, and can move faster and faster than the regular crabs. Most Overgrown Crabs have been trained and used by the navy for long periods of time; through their tenure as beasts of war, they have been trained in the elegant and fine arts of slicing humans in half with sharp pincers. The water-launching capabilities of the crabs have also become more efficient due to experience."
