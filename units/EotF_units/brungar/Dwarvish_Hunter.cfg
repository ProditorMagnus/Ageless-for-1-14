    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
The Hunter class was one of the first to be established after the Brungar separated from their knalgan ancestors. As such, they have become the backbone of the Brungar and act both as their primary source of food and as the backbone of their military. While the Dwarvish Hunters are still novices in the art of hunting, they are eager to better learn from their master how to hunt, so that they may have more food for their family. They yearn for the day when they will be skilled enough to fell cuttlefish single-handedly and sacrifice the mighty beast to their god."
