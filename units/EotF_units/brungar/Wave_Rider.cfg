    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

After a Brungar gains a high level of control over the water, they advance to the rank of Wave Rider. They are able to summon large, fast-moving waves to slam into any opponent that enters into their domain. They now also wield a harpoon instead of their fists, because it better serves its dual purpose-hunting food and hunting intruders. The Wave Riders are often among entertainers as well as soldiers for them riding the waves on their runic paddles is truly an awe-inspiring sight and thrills many to the bone."
