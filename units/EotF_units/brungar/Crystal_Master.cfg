    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

The Crystal Masters are very few, but legends of their power are still widespread. It is said that a single Crystal Master and a few of his strongest disciples were able to destroy an army of several hundred all by themselves. While their mighty hammers are hard to weild in the waters by normal Brungar, due to the runes on the hammer as well as the magical power that runs through the veins of the Crystal Master, this Brungar has very little trouble crushing skulls both in the deep caverns of the ocean and on the dry plains."
