    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Some Brungar decide that they would rather learn how to control their surroundings-the liquid water-rather than a mount. The Ocean Apprentice is the most basic of this, utilizing compressed jets of water to knock their opponents into submission. If their enemies happen to come to close to them, they rely on their fists to knock them back to where their powerful water jets can blast them back. As they learn more and more about the water around them, they come closer to deciding to use water to its fullest, or converting it to another deadly weapon."
