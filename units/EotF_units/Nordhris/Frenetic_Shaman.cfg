    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

While they carry the name 'shaman', they bear almost no resemblance to their elven counterparts. These shamans of the Nordhris have decided to focus all of their time and effort to ridding the undead and their masters from the world. The youngest and least experienced of them, the frenetic shaman, have begun learning the intricacies casting arcane spells in order to undo the evil magic that allows necromancers to animate corpses and bind souls to their will. This is not enough, however. The shamans are also able to go into a berserk frenzy at will, and are capable of taking down most enemy mages with ease. It is almost solely due to the effort of these shamen that the undead have been nearly eliminated from their lands and all of the surrounding territories."
