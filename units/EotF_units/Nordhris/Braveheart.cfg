The Braveheart class are the most expendable units of the Nordhris military, and as such, they form the vanguard of any Nordhris assault force. Those who choose to enter into the Nordhris military as a Bravehearts, despite the overwhelming odds of their death, are often regarded as either very courageous or very stupid. The truth, however, is that most Bravehearts are of the lower classes and join to escape the depressing realities of their own situation in life; whether it be debt, starvation, homelessness, or something else entirely. There is also another reason for joining: the sheer number of deaths in their ranks mean that anyone who survives long enough (sometimes only a few years) will be granted a position of leadership among the Bravehearts - along the the amenities and status that comes with any position of leadership in the military."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LOW_UPKEEP}
