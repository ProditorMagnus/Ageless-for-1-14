    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

In the harsh cold of the north, simply staying alive is a challenge. This is why the Nordhris have learned to combine herbal remedies, though herbs are scarce in the arctic weather, with magical healing. Apprentices have only just begun to learn the healing arts, and, though they are not the most effective healers, know how to use herbs to their maximum potency. This lets them be reduce the cost of ingredients. Apprentices are also much in tune with the cold of the north, and can call down violent gusts of arctic wind upon their enemies, even in the warmest and calmest atmospheres. Apprentices and their masters are the most used to cold weather, and are comfortable enough to walk barefoot in the snow."
