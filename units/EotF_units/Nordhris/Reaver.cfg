Of all the available positions in the Nordhris army, reavers are perhaps the hardest to qualify for. To become a reaver, one must be almost as fast as a snowrunner and as stealthy and strong as an arctic prowler. Most importantly, however, reavers must master the kusari, a hand scythe with a ball and chain attached. In combat, reavers have two roles: hiding in the dark behind the enemy to prevent a retreat, and chasing after those who do succeed in fleeing. A favorite reaver tactic is to entangle an enemy from afar using the ball and chain end of their weapon, and then slicing them to ribbons with the bladed side."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_NIGHTSTALK}
