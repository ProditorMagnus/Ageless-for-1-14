    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Of all the available positions in the Nordhris army, reavers are perhaps the hardest to qualify for. To become a reaver, one must be almost as fast as a snowrunner and as stealthy and strong as an arctic prowler. Most importantly, however, reavers must master the kusari, a hand scythe with a ball and chain attached. In combat, reavers have two roles: hiding in the dark behind the enemy to prevent a retreat, and chasing after those who do succeed in fleeing. A favorite reaver tactic is to entangle an enemy from afar using the ball and chain end of their weapon, and then slicing them to ribbons with the bladed side."
