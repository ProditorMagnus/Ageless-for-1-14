When an apprentice has gone through many years of training, and proven themselves worthy in combat as warriors who can heal their comrades in arms even in the heat of battle, they are granted the title of witch doctors, and allowed to take on their own apprentices. The name originated when an extremely talented apprentice went south with a Nordhris war tribe, to raid the humans in the warmer regions. While looting, he came across herbs the likes of which where never seen in the arctic. When he returned home, the apprentice used his new herbs to heal so well, he was declared a witch. A common witch doctor philosophy is that experience is the best teacher, and where better to find injured people to cure than in the middle of a battleground? Though, of course, witch doctors aren't often seen in combat: when the councilors request a healer for war, this is the argument they use to convince their apprentices to go. Witch doctors normally work in Nordhris villages, where they heal the injured and the sick, for a price, of course. Witch doctors can both heal better and summon storms better than their apprentices, and are sometimes hired by richer warriors as private physicians in combat."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
