    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

After a frenetic shaman has reached a certain level of skill and power, they are deemed worthy of the title 'Sage'. These sages are the both the most devoted and the most powerful of their shaman brethren, and have continued their training to the exclusion of nearly everything else. As such, they are now easily capable of taking down nearly any undead that they come across be it the minions or their master. This single-mindedness has cost them though, as they are rather easily killed by any opponent who is not undead. Despite this weakness, they are highly respected within Nordhris society and are given the dual tasks of educating new recruits - and executing any found to be experimenting with the dark arts."
