    description= _ "The people now known as the Nordhris were once citizens of the peaceful southern lands. Fearing that the decadence and folly they saw in their brethren would be their undoing as well, they wandered northward, away from long lazy summers and the trappings of civilization.
Their new unforgiving home has hardened their bodies and purified their spirits, allowing them to tap into the primal spirit of the White Lands. By their self-inflicted ordeal were they changed, skin becoming rougher, hair more pronounced; the value of gold and gems dimmed in their eyes, for what was required for survival was the family, the clan, and the cooperation of the band – the Pack.

Hunting, herding and foraging for subsistence, or raiding the spoiled humans of the lowlands, the Nordhris are a people close to nature, which is reflected in their tools and attire – leather, fur and wood is worn for protection from the cold and the blows of enemies. Horn, stone and wood are the primary material for weapons, with metal being used mainly for spear and axeheads.
In summer, their people roam far and wide in search of bounty and adventure, dwelling in large rotund tents they can fold and erect in a matter of minutes, while for winter, they return to fortified settlements to share tales, arrange weddings, and celebrate in the fires‘ glow.

Men and womanfolk have widely separated duties and privileges in the Nordhric society; while males have say over matters of the hunt, war, some crafts, and are deemed connected to the spirits of beasts, women have say over matters of the hearth, such as marriage, and tend to many crafts including that of the brewer, tending the grounds, midwives, and seeing to the smaller fortifications of the winter fortress; theirs is the connection to the Earth and all that grows from her body.
While worldy matters are decided by the war leader, the Horn-Crowned patriarch chosen by a gathering of grown males, and by the Summer, Autumn, and Winter Queens, three women, a maiden, a mother and a crone, in times of crisis the people look to the Shamans, who are privy to the deepest mysteries of the spirits and act as keepers of lore and of the Law. While they watch the observance of law by others, the shamans are subject to a harsh law themselves – should they fail in their duties, or abuse the law for their gain, they will be found dead one morning, frightened to death by the spirits of the ancestors.
Disputes are settled by individuals or small proxy forces at most; warfare between the clans is considered taboo. Trials will be held at the height of winter, when breath freezes right in front of the mouth. Men will do combat practically naked, armed but with ritual iron blades; the last man standing – or holding the knife – has justice on his side. Most often, one contestant will throw away the blade beforehand, as the icy iron is excruciatingly painful to the touch.

The Nordhris are a feral people, deliberately so. Their prime focus is upon retaining and emphasizing what makes them human, and to that end, they live every day to the fullest. Willingly and intentionally have they rejected the trappings of civilization, and with them greed, treachery and decadence; their system of taboos reflects this. Even today, when someone presents a member of a clan with a written contract to sign, he can expect to have his arms ripped out of the sockets."
