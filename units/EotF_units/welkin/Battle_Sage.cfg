    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
After countless encounters with the enemy, the Battle Sage has grown tired of his inability to fight well with a  weapon and so has taken up training to wield a glaive. Through their hard training these Welkin have become quite fierce. This training, however, has disrupted the balance of their study of the arts of the moon and sun and therefore  have disturbed the harmony of their power flow. Because of this distubance the Battle Sage's curative abilities have  diminished slightly, but is made up for with the impressive strength these Welkin have gained."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_HEALS}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_UNPOISON}
