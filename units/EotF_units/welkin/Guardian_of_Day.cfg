The Guardian of Day's great dexterity contradicts the popular thought that all Welkin are frail. Trained to use a mace these Welkin epitomize power. with the agility of the Welkin, and the strength from their training, these Guardians are a force to be reckoned with. although these Welkin possess amazing strength, they are also quite agile, however are also so heavy that their wings cannot hold them aloft. Like their counterparts, the Luna Protectors, the Guardians of Day keep their wings in their armor to keep them from being damaged. Due to the limited reach of the mace, they have been trained in the art of the sun, granted to them from Aten, to ward of distant enemies."
