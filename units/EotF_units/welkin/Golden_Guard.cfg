    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
Considered to be the most steadfast soldier in the entire Army of Aten, the Golden Guard has amassed enough strength as to be able to wield two maces. And since the Golden Guards can't use their wings anyway, they are equipped with impressive  armor that is almost impenetrable without decreasing their already limited mobility. They are not usually found on the front lines, due to their restricted mobility, but rather they are usually found as Honor Guards or protecting precious convoys."
