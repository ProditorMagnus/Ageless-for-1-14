The Sentinels of the Moon are known and revered for their strength and prowess during battle. Still they protect Thoth and still they grow stronger. When attacked these soldiers have been trained to destroy the enemy at any and all costs! These Welkin are so loyal to Thoth that they continue to fight during the hours of the day, and have acquired so much strength that there is no difference in their fighting capabilities in battle during the day or night."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_STEADFAST}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FIRSTSTRIKE}
