    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

The Astral Ranger is probably one of the most talented soldiers in the Army of Thoth, and also the most magical. This, along  with their odd outward appearence, makes them unpopular among the Welkin. These Welkin have traveled the land with their long  dark robes helping those in need. They carry no weapons except a hammer of ice which they created with their skill as do the lesser of their order. When found on the battlefield they often leave a trail of the fallen who have been crushed by  their incredible hammer."
