    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

These elves are those which are, if possible, even more devout and have spent more time in their effort to please Aten then any others of their order. In response to this great sacrifice, Aten has greatly increased the embodiment of his  power. The Solar Empyreans glow with his radiance and at the touch of their hands his flame is ignited. These Welkin have no need of staff or material weapon for the Power of Aten flows through their veins. They are a sight to behold on the battlefield, glowing like a small sun during the day or shining like a star during the night, drawing the army towards them like a beacon."
