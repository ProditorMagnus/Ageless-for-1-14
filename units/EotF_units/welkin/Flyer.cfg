    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
The most common of the Welkin, Flyers are very distinguishable by their flaming red hair and menacing ring blade. Because they are the main fighting force of the Army of Aten, Flyers must be at least equally skilled in the use of their ring blade and the flame, despite being devout followers of the sun. The Welkin are known for their pacifism, as the Flyers show by staying away from a fight whenever possible. However, due to their high sense of honor, conflict cannot always be avoided."
