    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

As the Sage's ability grows and his wisdom exceeds that of the other sage's he will have approached the point of becoming an Elder Sage. These Welkin study hard and have learned ways to twist and manipulate water that most find inconceivable. Though a healer, the Elder Sage can be a fierce foe. These Welkin, though an imposing threat on the field of battle, are best left  out of the fray because of the frailty of their body. When they are not in battle, they are often found healing those who have fought in battles or curing the ailments of those with diseases."
