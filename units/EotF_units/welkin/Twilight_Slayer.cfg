    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
The Twilight Slayers have, unlike others that had also chosen to be Star Shooters, given up the study of the moon for the training to become the masters of the sword . These Welkin have studied the sword so as to find out all the capabilities of the incredibly versitile weapon. These elves not only use the sword in melee combat but also hurl their swords as a lesser Welkin would throw a dagger. This intimidatation makes their foe reluctanct to face them."
