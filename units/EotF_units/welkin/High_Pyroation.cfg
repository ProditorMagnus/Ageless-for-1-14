High Pyroations are the first in their order to take with them a staff for use in battle. It is often thought by younger more immature Welkin that the High Pyroation takes a staff to help him walk due to his age. This, however, is merely a myth. These followers of Aten have also learned that with the controlling of their temper they can better control the fire that rages within them, which allows them to be more articulate and to better advise their Lords. They still study and pray to Aten, not so that they might gain power or honor, but rather because of their wonderous devoutness to their god. These Welkin are still quite frail and cannot withstand the great ferocity of the battlefield but if well protected, they can help change the tide of any battle."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
