    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

With their strength growing with each battle, the Battle Seer's are one of the deadliest foes in the great Welkin Army. But because their time is spent more in training with their physical weapons instead of practicing the art of healing, Aten and  Thoth have taken away much of their magic as well as the ability to use the Power of Thoth as effectively as they once could. They  can still cure ailments such as poison but they cannot heal wounded soldiers as they once did. The Battle Seers, however,  do not fret over their loss, instead they fight on to win great honor and valor! With their power of healing taken away and  their great glory on the battlefield, some of these Welkin have become somewhat arrogant and are often avoided by other  Welkin."
