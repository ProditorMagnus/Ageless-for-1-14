    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.
 
The Flurry's which have chosen the strength over spirit are those of the Talon Order. They train hard so as to be able to wield their claw blades to their greatest capabilities, while still maintaining their twister of wind which allows them to fly. Although they are not as prevalent in the art of the wind, these Welkin are still a deadly force from a distance. However, if one does attack a Talon Warrior from a distance, they are the lucky ones for their true power lies in their claws."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
