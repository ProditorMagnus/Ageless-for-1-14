    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

The Hierarchs are the highest possible position to hold for those who follow Aten. They show no outward flame but rather carry a great staff that signifies the unity of the Welkin in their worship of both Aten and Thoth. This does not grant any strange power but is merely symbolism to show that their sociecties can connect. Although rarely found on the field of battle, the Hierarchs of Aten possess tremendous power and are greatly feared. The king therefore often uses Hierarchs not only as advisors but also as diplomats or messengers, hoping to use this intimidation to his advantage."
