    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

These Welkin are those which epitomize the characteristical elvish swiftness. They are Welkin that have excelled in their skill with the bow. They have rid themselves of all other weapons so as to have a better knowledge and skill of both the bow and the power of Thoth. These Welkin move swiftly and take out their enemy from a distance, but cannot protect themselves if an enemy manages to get close enough for a melee attack."
