    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

 As the only ones to continue to use a bow in the Army of Thoth, the Deadeye are the greatest marksman of their kind. With the eyes of the elves these Welkin can pinpoint precisely where they wish to strike and hit it with little difficulty. They have not forsaken their god though and continue to follow Thoth with devotion and prayer. As a result, they have grown quite skillful at using the Power of Thoth. Although not as powerful as the Astral Ranger and not nearly as powerful as the Doyens, the Deadeyes are a foe to be reckoned with."
