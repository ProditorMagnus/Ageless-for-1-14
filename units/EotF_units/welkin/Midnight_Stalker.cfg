    description= _ "This unit is from the Era of the Future. Its coding, art, and ideas were done by Turuk, Mirion147, Huston, Pentarctagon, Wesfreak, Xandria, and Zerovirus.

Those that have proven their worth and stealth have been promoted to Midnight Stalker. These Welkin are the 'underground' of the Army of Thoth. They fight from the shadows and have learned when best to strike a fatal blow on a foe. The Midnight Stalkers should not be generalized as just spies for they can hold their own on the battlefield, both with the sword and the Power of Thoth. Midnight Stalkers not only fight from the shadows, they become the shadows. If a foe comes across one of these Welkin in the night they very well may be the last thing they see, if they see them at all."
