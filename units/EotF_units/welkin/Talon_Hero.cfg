These elves train with the claw. They have become the quickest assassins in the land. However, they do not stalk around like assasins, rather, they move proudly toward their foes making their enemies fear them for their battle prowess. They are not to be picked off either, for if you miss they can blast their enemy away with their power of wind. The Talon Warriors are the first of their order to equip themselves with armor. They wear a breastplate for protection but this decreases their speed. However, their speed is so great that this extra wieght does not decrease their fighting  prowess in the slightest."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
