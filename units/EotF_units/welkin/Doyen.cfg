With the wisdom aquired through their studying and practice, the Doyen's healing power is strong. However, their skill in the Power of Thoth has also greatly increased as they strive for the peak of the road to Thoth. These  Welkin are ever seeking to become Patriarchs of their gods. They fight bravely for their people and have been the wisest advisors of their king or queen. Since they still follow both Thoth and Aten, they are looked on with distain. However, because of their great power and wisdom, they are not shunned as the lesser sages of their order are."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CURES}
