    description={AE_RHY_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "When the lights start to fade and parents bring their kids to bed, they tell the bad children dark tales before sleep. A gruesome one, based on a real events, is the legend of Karasu the Raventrainer.Before Karasu was born a seer came to her parents to warn them of the child. The seer had foreseen how vicious and cruel Karasu would be and convinced the father to kill the child as soon as it was born. In a stormy night, while the father was out hunting, the mother was in labor and after few hours the baby was born. The mother fell in love with her child and decided to protect it from its father. So she packed the baby in linen and fled into the night, even though she was still in a weakened state.
A few hours later the father returned and was furious when the maid told him what happened. He took his dog and crossbow and went after the runaways. Soon the dog had tracked down the two near a mountain cliff. The mad father shot a bolt right through the mother heart, who colappsed in an instant. Taking his knife from his belt the man approached the crying baby to finish what he'd done, but an unkindness of ravens appeared on the sky and plunged on the two hunters. In few second the birds had completely mangled them to a point, where it was hard to tell which body was man and which dog.It is unknown what happened in the next years. Some say Karasu was found and raised by a traveller, in the most common theory she was raised by wild animals.About a decade later stories where heard about a girl in the wilds, who traines birds for hunting. Many had looked for her, some claim to have spotted her from a distance, but anyone who had approached the maiden was never to be seen again.At dusk, when Karasu was about twenty years old, she appeared in her home village with 13 ravens. She didn't speak a word, only stood there as if she was waiting for something. Then, when the sun was gone, the ravens screamed and fell upon the villagers. More birds began to appear and they clawed and pecked on the villagers faces, while the they could only flee in panic. Soon everything was silent again, exept for the sounds as Karasu and her birds feasted on the corpses. Before the sun could rise again the bodies were plucked dry to the bone.Though Karasu never attacked any other villages, lone travellers often dissapear on her mountain and there are many stories about the ravengirl."
