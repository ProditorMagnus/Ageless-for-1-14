    description={AE_RHY_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "For the longest time Aquana only use spears and swords in melee and javelins for ranged attacks. As they conquered more and more lands they discovered the limit of those weapons in encounters against the Elysian archers. While the conservative leaders clinged to the old ways, more liberal-minded Aquanas chose to replace their javelins with bows. It took a long time, but eventually bows were adapted as the main ranged weapon for its superior range and capacity."
