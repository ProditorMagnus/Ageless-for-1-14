    description={AE_RHY_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "The Dardo use chariots to reinforce their cavalry with bowmen. Shooting from the wagon instead of a horseback increases the stability and still allows quick movement. While the chariots are exellent on large planes, their size makes it difficult to move and maneuver in narrow or rough terrain.Note: Chariots use only 4 movement on attack instead of all. This allows them to disengage after their attack, if they haven't used all movement yet or moved into an enemies zone of control this turn."
