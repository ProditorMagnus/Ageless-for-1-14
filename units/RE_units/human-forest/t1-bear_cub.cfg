    description={AE_RHY_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Deep in the forest spiritual magic is still strong, allowing creatures to exist, that have no place elsewhere.Strong spirits control the trees and from bodies out of twigs. Their appearance allows them to blend in perfectly with their natural habitat and they can regenerate themself with nearby wood. If threatend the spirits can attack with all the might of the forest, but they also have a great weakness to fire and magic.
The weaker ones are called cubs and grow leaves on their back to be able to hide in the forest. They are not easily tamed, but are friendly to those who respect the forest."
