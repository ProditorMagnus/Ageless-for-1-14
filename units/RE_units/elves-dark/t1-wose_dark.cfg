    description={AE_RHY_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Dark Woses were corrupted through black magic. The Mages have tormented the mostly peaceful creatures to a point where they want to take revenge on every living being. Dark Woses are better adapted to the harsh enviroment -like caves- , where darkelves live in, and are more resistant against the cold. The torture has permanetly damaged their wood-like body,  making them weaker against blade and impact weapons."
