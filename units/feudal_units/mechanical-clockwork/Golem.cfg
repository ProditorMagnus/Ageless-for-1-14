    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

These are 'adult' contraptions, and as such, somewhat larger. However, they do not loose the mobility of their earlier years. These bizarre animals use their sticklike arms to bludgeon their foes to death, and their mercilessness is feared by all."
