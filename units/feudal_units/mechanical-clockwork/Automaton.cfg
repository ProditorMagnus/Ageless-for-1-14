    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

These are the most formidable contraptions ever faced: they have reached their peak of physical prowess, and with it, they grow an extra pair of limbs, which they use to scuttle like spiders, leap like frogs, and rend their foes like the merciless killers they are."
