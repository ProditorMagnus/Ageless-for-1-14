    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

A Herder of sufficiant ability can become what the Steppe Orcs call a Drover, the elite of the IceWind order. With age and experience in the control of elemental magics. Some have claimed to be capable of summoning forth fierce blizzards from a clear sky, an unlikely feat unconfirmed by outsiders. When asked about the mechanics of their abilities they often answer by refering to themselves as "conduits". Just what it is that they channel is never revealed.
The tribespeople claim to notice a blue tinge that begins to pervade their normally brown complexion and a crystalline hardness of their skin. Other steppe orcs whisper that this is because their hearts pump not blood, but ice."
