    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The orcs of the steppe learnt early on that their axes were simply not suitable against all foes. In accordance with this, some warriors forgo further usage of the axe and take up short spears. While neccesary, the change is often somewhat awkward."
