    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The Stoic are embodiments of endurance, plain and simple. They are characterized by sheer stubbornness and refusal to go down even under the heaviest of blows. Time and again a foe has struck down a Stoic and thought him dead, only to see the hardy orc lift himself from among the corpses of the dead, raise his shield and reasume his position."

        note=_ "Due to their lack of weaponry this unit can not attack the enemy. When attacked however, they retaliate with heavy strikes with the front of their shields."
