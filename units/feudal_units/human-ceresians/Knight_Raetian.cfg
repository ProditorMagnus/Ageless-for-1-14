When Alfhelm Alfricsson sacked Lavinium, the Lavinian general Sextus Raetius turned against the emperor and fought on Alfhelm's side. He did this, his eponymous Order claims, in order to preserve what could be preserved of Lavinian civilization - if he had not done so, the entire city would have been burned to the ground. In later days, the Raetian Knights fought against any who threatened their efforts to preserve and restore that civilization, including their own nominal lieges."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_ARCANE}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_HEALS}
