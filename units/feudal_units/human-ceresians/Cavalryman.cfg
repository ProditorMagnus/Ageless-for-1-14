    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The open plains of Ceresia are ideal for cavalry tactics - and unsurprisingly, the Ceresian cavalry are some of the finest in the world. They are equipped with swords and plate armour, and they ride fearlessly into the fray."
