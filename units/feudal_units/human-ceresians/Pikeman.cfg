    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Pikemen are a key part of any Ceresian infantry contingent. Their long pikes allow them to fend off attacks with impunity, and when arrayed in battle formation they are a fearsome foe. But while they have a number of different roles, many would say that their real purpose is to protect the Ceresians' renowned crossbowmen."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+"A Halberdier has the Formation ability; its physical resistances are increased by 20% when it is adjacent to another unit with this ability."
