    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Master of both sword and magic, a Sylvanus is a warrior whose heritage reaches back to the days of Vanimaro himself. The sight of one on the battlefield will never fail to terrify his foes; they are much feared for their ability to call down lightning, without warning, from a cloudless sky."
