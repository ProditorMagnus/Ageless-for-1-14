    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The lords of the High Elves lead their men with brilliance of both thought and deed, and as such are often targeted by an enemy hoping that if the head is cut off, the body will die. The Shieldbearers are tasked with accompanying these great lords, forming an impenetrable wall to defend them from the assaults of the enemy, or with securing strategic points before reinforcements can arrive. Because they carry great tower shields, even larger than those of the Lavinians, many a man has assumed them to be slow and lumbering. Many a man has also been thrown to the ground by a surprisingly quick blow from a Shieldbearer's shield."
