    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
High Elven horse archers who continue their martial pursuits are known as savaris. Years of training with the bow have given these elves a level of skill that no other race can rival. While their effectiveness in melee is still poor compared to other cavalry, they are rightly feared in battle; they can rain down arrows on the enemy ranks before retreating suddenly, out of range of any retribution."
