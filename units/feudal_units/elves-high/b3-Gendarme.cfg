    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Lanciers' preferred method of attack - a single, head-on charge - is so risky that most are killed in battle before they can perfect their skills. Those that survive to become veterans are inevitably masters of fighting and horsemanship. Known as gerdarmes, these menn are among the most terrifying opponents that can ever be met in battle; their charges are nigh-on unstoppable, causing untold devastation when they strike."
