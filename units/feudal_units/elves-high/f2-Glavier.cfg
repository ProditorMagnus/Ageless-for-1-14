    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Most men prefer clubs, axes, and other barbaric weapons to the spear, which they view as a cheap alternative, to only be used against cavalry or due to the lack of more suitable weaponry. Not so with the High Elves. Their Spearmenn are equipped with glaives, a flexible and deadly cousin of the spear. Those who learn to capitalize on the strengths of the glaive become Glaviers, wielding their finely crafted polearms with speed that rivals that of a sword. They confound enemies with the designs they weave in the air with the shining tips of their great weapons, then strike with great scything blows that, while powerful, are painstakingly precise."
