    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The most daring chargers often choose to continue fighting with lances alone. While this is a dangerous tactic - a failed charge leaves few survivors - it is terrifically effective when used propery. Lanciers can run down an enemy without their foes being able to strike a single blow."
