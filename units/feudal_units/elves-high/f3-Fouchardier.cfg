    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
In each schiltron, there are bound to be at least a handful of Fouchardiers. These former Schiltrons are esteemed veterans, but not merely longstanding members of their group.

To become one of the honored Fouchardiers, a Schiltron must fight a battle alone, without his formation. Due to difficult nature of the wielding of the pike without support, many do not pass this test, instead succumbing to their inexperience and fear. Oddly enough, Fouchardier are encouraged to receive wounds during their test, and each has many scars. This lends itself to an easy system of distributing the Fouchardier among the schiltrons: each schiltron is allotted thirty scars."
