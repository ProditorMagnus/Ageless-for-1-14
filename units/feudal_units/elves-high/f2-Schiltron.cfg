    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The most agile and quick Spearmenn become Schiltrons, taking their name from their formation of choice, the ring of pikes invented by the Keltoi in ancient times. Though their talents may seem better suited to the more flexible glaive, the Schiltrons need agility in great measure, as the pikes they wield, though of High Elven manufacture, and shorter than average, are, ultimately, pikes, and thus unwieldy and unbalanced. Their skill compensates for this, and they strike with great speed, withdrawing and jabbing their pike many times, then fading back into the impenetrable thorn bush that is the schiltron."
