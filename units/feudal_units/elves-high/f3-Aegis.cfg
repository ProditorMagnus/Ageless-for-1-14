The Aeges are the elite of the shieldbearers. They are everywhere known for their immense strength, and rightly so, for they trudge into battle equipped with the finest full plate armor and great shields of steel yet are no slower for it. Like the shieldbearers, they guard the greatest of the elves, and when their charge is threatened, they fight to the death, forming an impenetrable wall before him - a wall bristling with glistening steel, a wall of overlapping scales, a wall of might, skill, and undying loyalty."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_STEADFAST}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_FORMATION}
