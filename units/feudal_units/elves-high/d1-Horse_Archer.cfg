    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The High Elves developed a number of types of cavalry during their early years in Silvia. One of the most straightforward of these is the horse archer: a rider equipped with a bow and a short sword, intended for speed and agility in hit-and-run attacks. These warriors make no pretense of compromise - they are weak in melee, and a disciplined force of knights or pikemen presents them with a serious problem - but when striking against an unprepared foe, they are deadly indeed."
