    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Those who become true masters of the glaive will generally become Captains, esteemed by all their comrades. None are trained for this role of leadership; they simply acquire it through bravery, cunning, and skill with their weapon. Despite this ostensible lack of tactical expertise, once they are respected enough, less skilled troops will pledge themselves to the Captain's banner, and the great elven sages will commence the training of the new cohort. A cohort fights as one, each elf covering the next with his swirling blows, the Captain at the fore, pressing the enemy back, and leading his troops to victory.

The Captains wield a weapon even more deadly and sophisticated than the glaive: the dual glaive. These they spin in the air, slashing, jabbing, scything through flesh, bone and steel, turning even bloodshed into an art."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
