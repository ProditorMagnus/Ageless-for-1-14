    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The finest of High Elven archers are posessed of skills that seem incredible to other menn. They consider themselves a class apart from their brethren, it is said that among their number are warriors who voyaged across the northern ice and fought alongside the first Issaelfr lords, or even Vanimaro himself. These tales do not seem unlikely given their amazing prowess; though they train almost constantly, it is easy to believe that only centuries of war could produce such mastery."
