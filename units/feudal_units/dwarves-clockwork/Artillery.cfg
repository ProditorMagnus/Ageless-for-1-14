    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The dwarves most proficient with their 'guns' use even larger, more complex ones. These artillerymen fire shells as big as a man's fist at the same rate as their comrades fire smaller shells. Though not as a large as the rocks flung by catapults, the dwarven artillery prove quite effective against fortifications and troops alike."
