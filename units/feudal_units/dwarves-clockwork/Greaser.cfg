    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

To keep the myriad of dwarvish devices oiled and running, the clockwork dwarves hire greasers. Greasers are not manual laborers, but skilled repairmen. They carry an array of toils, not least among them being inflammable concoctions. If caught on the battlefield in the act of repair, greasers are far from defenseless - in fact, they are some of the most deadly dwarven recruits."
