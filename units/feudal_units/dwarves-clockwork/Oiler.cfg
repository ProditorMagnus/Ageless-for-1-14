    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Oilers are simply more experienced greasers- they are proficient in more methods of repair, and, as such, are permitted to use more dangerous but effective elixirs to perform their duties. Thus, they have more powerful methods of defense on the battlefield, and can even hurl flaming globes of a gelatinous substance at their foes, wreaking great havoc."
