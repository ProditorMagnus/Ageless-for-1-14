These shiftless vagabonds are fringe members of dwarven society. They do have a hold to call their home, but rove far and wide across the world seeking to exorcise their wanderlust. Dwarves make poor wanderers, however, as they avoid horses and boats, and their legs cannot carry them far or fast. Thus, wanderers equip themselves with giant mechanical legs, which they control with their own. These massive devices eventually become as one with the dwarf, and after years of wandering, a wanderer is inseparable from his legs. When he must fight, a wanderer wields a lance-not a long, smooth lance like that of the humans, but a machinery-covered pole that can be folded into a pocket."
