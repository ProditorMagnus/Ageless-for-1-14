These former miasmists are as coldblooded as the contraptions, a necessary attribute of one who commonly melts his foes into a pile of liquefied flesh. In the tank on a Gas Baron's back, there is a chemical, the composition of which is known to none but him. Thus, each brutally kills his foe in a different method, but all do so with an inscrutable steely glint in their eyes."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}
