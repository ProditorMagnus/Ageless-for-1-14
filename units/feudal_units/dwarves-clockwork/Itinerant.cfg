    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Many ramblers forsake their lives of roving and return to a hold. Some do not. An itinerant is a dwarf whose wanderlust has made him an eternal outcast. He not only wanders, but avoids almost all mannish company, They bear flags on their great lances that warn all to stay away unless approached, lest the itinerant slay him in a fit of sociopathic rage."
