    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Blazers focus more on the power of their alchemical creations than their actually duties. Many are despised as pyromaniacal, but, on the fields of battle, the massive explosions they summon from flasks whose size belie their power earn them respect in the eyes of their fellows and foes alike."
