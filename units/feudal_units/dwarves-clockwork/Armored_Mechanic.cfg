    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The armored mechanics in a dwarven army are the first response personnel-for mechanical automata and vehicles, not menn. Even with great alchemical skills, these humanitarians would never survive in the front lines without armor. Their armor is not just solid steel like that of their enemies, but encrusted with tiny gears and mechanism which can catch or break an unwary foes blade."
