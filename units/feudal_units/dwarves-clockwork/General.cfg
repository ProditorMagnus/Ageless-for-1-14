    description= _ "This unit is from Feudal Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The swish, click, swish, click of a clockwork general's mechanical boots is feared by all non-dwarves. His metallic armor makes him as strong as two men, and he uses his widgets to deadly effect. He is a master of battlefield construction, and stories are told of generals who, having lost their blades, fashion a new weapon out of their armor."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
