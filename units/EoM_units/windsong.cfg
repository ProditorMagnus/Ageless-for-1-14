    description= {AE_EOM_RACE_NOTICE} + _ "The Windsong are a mysterious people, consisting completely of abducted female humans. Their numbers are few, and their goals and motives obscure. However they have demonstrated in the past that they are not to be trifled with. They have strange powers, and massive libraries and towers full of books of ancient lore. Their armies though few in number have defeated all of the many who've attacked them, or whom they've decided to attack. Humans hate them because they steal the most fit of their daughters right from under their noses. Most other races distrust them."
