    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "The sword dancer is a formidable warrior known for their lightning-fast movements and deadly precision. While their primary weapon of choice may be shortswords, they are just as skilled with their trusty chakrams in ranged combat. These unique fighters have honed their skills through years of practice and training, and their bodies are attuned to the rhythm of battle. Before each fight, they indulge in a ritual involving psychedelic substances, heightening their senses and allowing them to move with superhuman speed and agility. With their enhanced reflexes and keen instincts, they can effortlessly dodge enemy attacks and strike back with deadly accuracy. But their prowess doesn't stop there - these warriors also possess some regenerative abilities similar to those of Great Warlocks, allowing them to heal themselves during battle and stay in the fight longer. The end result is a fearsome opponent who can outmaneuver even the most skilled foes."
