    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "The Dark Assassins are stealthy and deadly warriors who excel in covert operations during nighttime battles. With their expertise in camouflage and silent movement, they can effortlessly navigate through enemy lines undetected, striking fear into the hearts of their foes. Their lightning quick reflexes make them equally adept at eliminating enemy leaders or picking off weakened soldiers in the enemy's rear, catching them off guard and leaving them vulnerable to attack. As if their speed and agility weren't enough, these assassins are almost as nimble as cavalrymen, allowing them to quickly retreat from dangerous situations while maintaining the element of surprise."
