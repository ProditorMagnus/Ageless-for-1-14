    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "The Chaos Hydra is a grotesque creation of dark sorcery, shaped by twisted rituals and arcane incantations designed to bring forth a weapon of destruction upon the mortal realm. Its imposing form looms over the battlefield, its massive body dwarfing even the bravest warriors. With each swing of its multiple heads, the Hydra leaves a trail of death and devastation in its wake, as if channeling the very essence of chaos itself. Its eyes glow with an otherworldly light, as if fueled by the malevolent energies that gave it life. It is a true terror of the battlefield, a relentless hunter with no regard for mercy or quarter, leaving nothing but ruin in its path."
