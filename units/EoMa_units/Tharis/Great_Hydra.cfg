    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Risen from the depths of the underground tunnels like a nightmarish manifestation, this towering, mature Great Hydra brooks no opposition. Its sheer size and ferocity make it a terror beyond compare, with three twisted heads, each one seemingly more malevolent than the last, the beast stalks its prey with unrelenting determination, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake. Those who have witnessed this abomination up close live only to bear witness to its fury, their screams and pleas for mercy lost to the echoes of the caverns."
