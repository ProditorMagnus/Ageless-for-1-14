    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Steam Turborserkers are fearsome war machines crafted from exceptionally high-quality parts. Their bulky frames are adorned with intricate gears and augmented with runes, while their limbs are articulated for maximum mobility. And on top of that, these mechanical warriors have a portable missile launchers attached to their metallic backs. When activated, they enter a berserk rage, and are able to lay waste to entire enemy squads. Leave no doubt about it - these machines were built for one purpose alone: to annihilate."
