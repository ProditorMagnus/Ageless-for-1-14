    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "For the fledgling soldier, camels are a rare spectacle to be seen on the fronts. Unlike their traditional brothers and sisters used as beasts of burden for travelling traders, the camels seen in battle are specially bred for speed and power rather than endurance. Riders carry a scimitar for melee skirmishes as well as dozens of smaller scimitars to hurl at faraway targets, a skill for which the camel rider is acclaimed for.

Trained in scouting and hit-and-run warfare, camel riders are the forerunners of the Summonersâ€™ brunt strength, moving at galloping speed into the fray."
