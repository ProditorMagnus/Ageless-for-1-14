    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Cyclops Brute is a clumsy, dim-witted warrior. Nevertheless, he possesses raw muscle mass and unwavering determination to fight alongside his kin, relying on sheer strength and tenacity to make up for his deficiencies. Wielding a massive wooden club, he swings with gruesome efficiency, crushing any foolish enough to stand in his way. Although his movements are cumbersome, his attacks are surprisingly effective, thanks to his immense physical prowess. Unfortunately, his lack of finesse means he struggles against opponents employing subtler strategies â€“ but don't underestimate this brute! In a straight-up slugfest, he'll leave many foes reduced to a bloody pulp."
