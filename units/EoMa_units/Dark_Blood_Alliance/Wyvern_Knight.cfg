    description={AE_EOMA_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Wyvern Knights are elite Darkblooded aerial cavalry, soaring in the skies atop magnificent Great Wyverns, its wings spread wide, ready to unleash devastation upon the enemy below. Equipped with a spear that seems almost puny compared to the massive creature he commands, a Wyvern Knight bravely charges into battle. Swooping down from the skies, the Knight impales his foes with his trusty pike, utilizing the sheer momentum of the dive attack. With each enemy of the Darkblooded slain, the knight gets more glory to his name, and his loyal wyvern gets to feast on the remains."
