Two centuries later and these lumbering beasts have flourished, growing in both strength and number. Some say that it was a strange magic which bound the cyclopes to their new allegiance and is perhaps a reason for their increased power. One thing about these beasts is a certainty: when facing one in combat it is best not to get hit."

It took one particularly mad and foolhardy goblin to change the fate of his people when he set out to tame the beasts. After several narrow escapes the goblin managed to steal an egg from the great birds and rose it under his care. Less than three months later when the Rocs attacked they were surprised to hear a piercing cry from above and even more surprised when they were ripped to shreds by one of their own. To this day the goblins ride tamed Rocs into battle, their battle cries the only warning of impending doom."

They inhabit a different dimension called the Abyss - a place full of primitive chaos, both creative and destructive in nature, where concepts like space and time can be rather difficult to apply. Initially, their bodies are shapeless clumps of energy due to the Abyss's nature, but once summoned to the mortal world, they change their form to either become living manifestations of elements, or become humanoid in appearance. The latter are technically not-living, and thus do not age, are not susceptible to any ailment, and damage to their bodies heals quite quickly."

They possess a range of abilities and weapons, including wrist blades, tridents, chakrams, nets, and maces. Their adaptive skin color and knowledge of the swamps allow them to easily ambush their enemies, while their ability to blend in with vegetation or change their skin color to match their environment gives them an added advantage in stealth and deception. Some salamanders specialize in aquatic ambushes, using their powerful jaws and webbed feet to strike from the depths of the water. Others are masters of desert combat, trained to fight in the scorching heat of the sun and armed with wrist blades and throwing knives dipped in poison. A select few are even rumored to have the power to control fire, making them feared and respected allies in battle. Regardless of their individual strengths and weaknesses, all salamanders share a deep connection to their natural environments and the ancient magic that flows through them."
