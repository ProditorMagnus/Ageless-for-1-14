    description= _ "This unit is from BEEM. Its coding and art were done by Voodoo, Baro_st, Tydeus, Dibs, and various others.

Some Dioi not only manage to survive, battle after battle, but also distinguish themselves for bravery and strength. These warriors are called 'Swordmasters' by the majority of the people, even if this rank doesn't exist in the Dioian society, which doesn't recognize differences between these warriors and the common swordsmen. However, when these extraordinary fighters are recruited by the Calydonian army, they receive an higher salary than the swordsmen and the veterans, which allow them to buy heavy armors and shields."
