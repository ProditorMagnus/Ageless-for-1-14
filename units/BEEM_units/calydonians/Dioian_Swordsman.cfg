Among the barbarous people of the Thracian, there is a tribe of men, called Dii or Dioi, who are famous for their bravery and their ability as swordsman. Even if the Calydonian army is not keen on recruit barbarians, the Dioian Swordsmen are often recruited because of their great skills. Armed only with a long sword, these strong and savage warriors are feared by every enemy."
