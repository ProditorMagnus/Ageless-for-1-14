    description= _ "This unit is from BEEM. Its coding and art were done by Voodoo, Baro_st, Tydeus, Dibs, and various others.

The Dioi are fearless and strong warriors, but they are not immortal and many of them die fighting. Nevertheless, some swordsmen manage to survive, battle after battle. These great warriors are admired by both their allies and their enemies. Even if the veterans rarely change their weapons, their experiences have made them more careful, so they usually use more protective armors than the ones wore by the swordsmen."
