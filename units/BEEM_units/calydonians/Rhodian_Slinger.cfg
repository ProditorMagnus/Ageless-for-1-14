    description= _ "This unit is from BEEM. Its coding and art were done by Voodoo, Baro_st, Tydeus, Dibs, and various others.
 
Often recruited to strengthen groups of Gymnets, the Rhodian mercenaries are known to be the best slingers in the Calydonian Hegemony. These soldiers usually don't throw stones as the other slingers, but use weights of lead which injure seriously the enemies. Even if these soldiers coming from Rhodes aren't good in melee fighting, they represent a great danger for every kind of soldier."
