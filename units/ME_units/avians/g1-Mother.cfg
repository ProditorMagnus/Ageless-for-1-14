    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"In avian culture, females are regarded in the highest respect. They are generally caring and nurturing compared to males, and will tend to most any non-hostile creature as if it were its young. Avian females do not reproduce similarly to humans, infact they're more similar to birds in that they lay eggs. This proves that they are not human along with the fact they cannot reproduce with humans. While their eggs are rockhard, they still require to be warmed by the plumage on the chests of Avian females, which are specially made to insulate. Avian females have larger wings than the males so to cover the eggs with more feathers and keep them even warmer, these large wings also allow them to produce powerful gusts of wind, often stronger than those of Avian footsoldiers."
