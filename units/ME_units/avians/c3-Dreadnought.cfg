    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"One day, an orcish warlord felt like going to attack the elves. While orcs are quite aggressive, and elves are quite territorial, it was a stalemate between the two, and both stood on the edge of their terrain holding steadfast for battle. After a week of this armsrace battle, an enourmous cloud passed over the two slowly, one of the elves remarked that it might rainsoon, as he looked at the luminous shadow, then he looked to the other side of the battlefield and exclaimed that the Orcs had fled, only to find that he was alone. Lets just say he wasn't a very smart elf to stand under a hungry bird."
