    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"The most bizarre result of a blob's evolution is unquestionably the amoeba. Although it does not possess nearly as much attack power as its brethren, it is almost thrice as massive as a typical blob and retains its awe-inspiring resistances, allowing it to easily hold a line and soak up punishment for the rest of the blighted horde. In addition to their sheer resilience, amoebas cannot be killed by sword-blowsâ€” when cleaved in two, the resulting mass takes on a mind of its own and a new blob is born.
 
Special notes: This units attack can absorb the bodies of living units and replenish its own health by draining it from others. After being dealt a blade attack, this unit will spawn a new blob with health equal to the damage taken."
