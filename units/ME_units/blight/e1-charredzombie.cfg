    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Among the countless unfortunate souls who have been corrupted by the blighted horde, there are some so severely burnt and mauled that they have become utterly unrecognizable to the people who were once their kin. Charred zombies stagger about the earth on decayed, burnt limbs, and if they have working minds, are intent on sharing their undead misery with others by stabbing away at them with the crude remains of a forearm. The easiest way to dispatch of one of these monstrosities is to shatter their bones with a mace or club, as they are almost impervious to blasts of fire or cold."
