    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"The blob's viscous and unconstrained body offers it many potential paths of evolution, and the slime is only its most common form. As these creatures grow, their mass doubles, and they boast far stronger attacks that turn them into fearsome foes in every aspect. It is a topic of debate among magi as to why these curious creatures become ever more robust under cover of night.
 
Special notes: This units attack can absorb the bodies of living units and replenish its own health by draining it from others."
