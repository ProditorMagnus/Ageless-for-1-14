    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"These peculiar masses of jelly, aptly called 'blobs'  by their oft-bewildered foes, are far more dangerous than they seem. Although they are fragile and slow, arrows and stones alike seem to pass harmlessly through their gelatinous bodies, and many a man has gone pale with fear to see his comrade engulfed and digested in the brightly colored mound before him. If not killed with all haste, the blob will soon take on a stronger and more freakish form.
 
Special notes: This units attack can absorb the bodies of living units and replenish its own health by draining it from others."
