    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Slimes that live long enough will inevitably accumulate a considerable amount of mass and battle experience that transform them into a deadly and efficient monster known as the ooze. Oozes have abandoned the lumpy and formless shape of their predecessors and adopted a more flexible, sleek build that allows them to both shatter and dissolve their enemies with ease. It is because of these damned creatures that there are tales of men vanishing from their posts at night along the blighted frontier, only to leave trails of mysterious, clear gel behind.
 
Special notes: This units attack can absorb the bodies of living units and replenish its own health by draining it from others."
