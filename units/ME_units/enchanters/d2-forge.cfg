    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Forges are experienced Enchanters who have mastered the basic skills involved in metallurgy and moved on to more advanced weaponcraft. They create the complicated weapons used by veteran troops, and have access to more resources than their underlings. On the field of battle Forges lead small bands of warriors, protecting their fellows from harm by supplying enchanted shields and swinging their mighty hammers."
