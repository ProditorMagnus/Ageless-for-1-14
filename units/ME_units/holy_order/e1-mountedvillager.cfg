    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"Mounted villagers are the patrols of the officer force. They patrol the streets looking for any signs of trouble. At the first sign of wrongdoing they find the nearest officer and lead him to the perpetrator with their keen eyes and quick steeds. If there are no officers in the area, the mounted officers will subdue the perpetrator with their trusty spear, although they prefer not to because most of these officers have been given their job because of their notable cowardice."
