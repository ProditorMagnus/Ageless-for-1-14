    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Occultists have improved the explosive reactions resulting in a bigger explosion. The process comes from success and failed tries of increased destructive explosive reactions which some of them does not even detonate while others explodes at the wrong offset. Occultists are also now more prepared against any possible reaction that could go wrong, which is also useful to take less damage from magicians."
