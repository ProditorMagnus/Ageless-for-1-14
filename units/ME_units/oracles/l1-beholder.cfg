    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"Through years of studying the summoning art, summoners have been able to concoct hundreds of creatures. Beholders, while physically frail and not combat worthy, were found useful by the headmasters of the Oracles facilities. They were originally used to scout out areas large and isolated enough for schools to be built on. Though when a single unwanted person might stumble upon a university of magic, beholders are sent out to find and eliminate them by staring the life out of them, or strangulating them with their tentacles.
 
Beholders are evil creations of a really twisted warlock. Usually beholders feed of birds and bats, hunting them with strikes of stare at far, once the prey is at close range the tentacle finishes the job. Beholders's evil appearance indicates that they are seething to anything else, but for some curious reason it's calm next to humanoid presence. Curiously, beholder understands most of the orders given to it even with no training at all, meaning that probably it has a kind of mental connection with anyone that the creator authorized."
