    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"After some time of training, their martial skills are improved considerably. Still, in hand to hand combat Guru is at a disadvantage against most warriors, but that doesn't negate that Oracles can use Gurus toughness in the field to protect their companions at being focused by enemies on the front line and preventing their more squishy companions be harmed so easily."
