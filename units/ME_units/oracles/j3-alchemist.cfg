    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Alchemists are mysterious, but admirable people in Oracle society. No-one knows how but they found a way to enlarge their longevity, secret that only Alchemists after hard working finds by themselves. To communicate their knowledge they encrypt it in order that only experienced occultists and alchemists can understand their secret knowledges. Once the explosive reaction is as big possible in a size that isn't dangerous to the alchemist himself."
