    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Quietus are people that are specialized to break life's motion quickly. But unlike Necromancers or Liches, they do not have the proper formation to send undead back to the graves. In oracle society Quietus are respected because they sense when someone is going to die soon because by practice they gained a kind of 6th sense that allows them to know when someone is close to death even if the other person does not even know and in some cases it can be prevented. As said, they're specialized to sending living people to death if he proposes that, his chillwaves are dangerous at distance and his infected staff with at least one successful hit the victim is already poisoned."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
