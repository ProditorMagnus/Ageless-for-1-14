    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"After certain training the master has sharpened his senses, letting him sense the environment much better so for other people he's no longer blind but he is still blind... but just that doesn't matter anymore because he can sense the world and fight by his way. Still, he maintains his nice reflexes at striking with his staff with an accuracy that will invalidate any kind of enemy's agility."
