    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"For some reason Oracles usually have more men, which can make predictions about the future than almost any other race, but it's true as well that more of them born without being capable to see anything even if it's in front of their noses. Also, being blind their other senses are considerably improved likely the hearing and mostly the touch. Not being capable of seeing the opponent he has in the front, they have not good properties to be warriors, apart they cannot see that well the environment in which he is fighting which decreases considerably his agility. Still, he can react very accurately, if someone strikes him with weapons at close range and the damage he will deal in retaliation is unexpectedly high. If facing him, it's better to use a ranged weapon negating his only strength in a fight."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_COUNTER}
