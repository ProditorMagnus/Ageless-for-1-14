    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Once a darkmage has the proper training, he's capable to raise zombies if their staff does the final hit. It's known that zombie servants have no will nor any kind of intelligence because the revival only works on the body (with a certain delay, demonstrating the small grade of putrefaction) and does not save the personality. Zombies do not have fears or preoccupations thing that helps them to be somehow useful in fights apart that they can continue the plague process. For not very known reason this kind of virus that necromantic uses at his staffs only works when a body is at a terminal situation meaning it's safe for anyone that is in a sane status."
