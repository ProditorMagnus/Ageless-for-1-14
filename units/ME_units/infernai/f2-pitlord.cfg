    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"While many pitfiends do grow their horns back during their eternity in the pit. They are never truly allowed back into the upper levels of hades because of the cannibalism involved in growing horns underground. To get any curve in the horns of a pitfiend would require feeding on imps, because Lost Souls are too pure and grow them straight. While feeding pitfiends are not a long the same level as other infernai, they are respected and revered by other pitfiends."
