    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+" After a long time of killing, it is impossible to avoid absorption of soul through the claws, even for a sadist. This strange addition to the horns causes them to curl at the tips, making them rather different looking than any other horn. This isn't the only noticable difference in long fighting sadists, as their blades are never cleaned, and the encrusted blood is superheated by hellfire, weighing down and sharpening their axes."
