    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"It's not known how some of the strongest samurais gets posssed by a demon, but it seems the emperor brings tributes to certain demonic entities in exchange of wealth and even more power. True thing is that the Emperor sends this type of samurais in some of most brutal invasions againist these residents that refuse to the Empire expansion. The emperor doesn't like much the demonic samurai at all... so he sends them as man killing machines in most wild wars, expecting as many of the military resistance and the demonic samurais themself perish while having quick and big profits for demonic samurais martyr."
