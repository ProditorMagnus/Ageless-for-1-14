    description={AE_MRC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"In slave encampments, there are often thousands of people, who do all the work, and also fight to protect the encampment. They get no pay, merely the knowledge that they are alive, and the hope for a better future if they work well. While they could run away, they much more fear death than they fear life as a slave. The crack of a whip is enough to move them to whatever their master wills."
