    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Throughout the world, there have been many reports of very strange phenomena that often occur deep within massive forests. Survivors typically report being under the effects of immense waves of dread, as if someone or something was watching them. Trying to investigate the source of fear typically results in nothing being found; occasionally, one may hear a beast roaring as they get closer to the alleged source of dread. The terror often continues for days until groups of vines burst out and pulls in the victim. It is unknown what exactly happens then, but it is commonly believed that the victim is eaten, as most stories involve seeing parts of the victim's body being present during later encounters. All known survivors have seen the beast, which is essentially a composite body of vines and other plant parts formed into the shape of a tiger, thus the common name of 'Vine Tiger.' Despite actually being very close to the beast, it is unknown why it let these people live; perhaps they did not offend the beast… or perhaps it was just no longer hungry…"
