    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"It is very rare for this demon species at large to dabble in the intricacies of the various types of magic, having adapted their body structure over time for feats of physical strength, much in the same vein as their distant cousins, the Valdemons. The endless wars waged in their homeworld during the Era of Strife have also contributed to a general scarcity of knowledge and those capable of spreading it.

In spite—or perhaps because—of this, the few individuals who attain control of those otherworldly powers not naturally available to them are respected by their people as the great spell-masters they strive to be."
