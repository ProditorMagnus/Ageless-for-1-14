    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"At the zenith of their career, mounted soldiers of Chaos go through unknown rituals and are ascended to the top of the hierarchy. They seem to have become, as their mounts, living, blood-thirsty killer machines. Although just respectable soldiers on their own, a few groups of Cataphracts at night are certainly enough to take over a large town."
