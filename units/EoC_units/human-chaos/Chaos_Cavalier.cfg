    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"With time, Chaos Raiders are ascended to higher ranks of the military, given better weapons, armor, and mount. The mount plays an essential role in the effectiveness of these units. Horses are, by nature, prone to be scared on the battlefield; when this occurs, the soldier mounted upon it is usually injured or killed by the confused animal.

The mounts used by Chaos Cavaliers, however, are not known to have ever reacted in such ways to the battle action. Their behavior suggests that they have been well trained for the horrors they face. Another possibility is that they are simply possessed by some demonic force, as are many other creatures under the control of these men."
