    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"It is said that experience makes real warriors. Unfortunately, that is true even for the Chaos vanguard forces and their messengers, which usually are not warriors in the beginning. They don't even wield real weapons - except for a club and a few javelins to throw - in that stage of their training, in which many die or get converted into undead or demons. But the bright ones who get to survive and gain experience become skilled enough to wield an axe. They are still far from mastering the use of battle axes, but that interim level is more than enough to cause trouble, death, and destruction to the opponents of Chaos, which is why they are titled the 'Marauders' by survivors of their deadly assaults."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
