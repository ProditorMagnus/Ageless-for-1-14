    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"The Chaos Hordes rely heavily on their lorekeepers' charisma to attract more practitioners and recruit new adepts. Some of those adepts do not have the magic skills to join the Invoker orders, but instead are used as messengers of doom, given a club, a small supply of javelins, and ridding them from their souls via the darkest arts known only by the demonic masters. They are then sent to spread fear and despair amongst their victims, decimating their defenses before the demons are unleashed and sent to finish the job. Their fanatism leads them to forget any forms of proper defense, and so, being rather weak and vulnerable, kill their opponents even if that would mean their own death."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
