    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"The most dreadful part of the doom messengers' training is being rid of their souls by their masters. However, the resultant warrior is a mix of endurance, agility, accuracy, and skill. These warriors don't need armor, for they don't fear death at all; therefore, they prefer to carry little - their garments and weaponry are minimal at best. Although they can be killed with ease by experienced and lucky opponents, the great damage they can deal before dying is enough to compensate the Chaos hordes for the loss.

Since they have been rid of their souls, it is believed that they kill and destroy searching for that which they have lost, or for a new one to fill its place in that empty shell called a 'body'. This rumor gave them the title of 'Soulhunters'."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
