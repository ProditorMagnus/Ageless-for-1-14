    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"In an age and land where men fight amongst themselves for the smallest piece of flesh and bloodshed constitutes their only form of entertainment, knowledge is essential to bring some order to the chaotic human instincts.

The great Lorekeepers of the Chaos Empire sit amongst ranks higher than those of the military, seen by Yechnagoth’s and Uria’s worshippers alike as near-godly figures. They are thus dedicated to promoting the creation of a new and better world by waging war on the purportedly selfish non-believers — the same peoples who call themselves the ‘free’ civilizations of Irdya.

These Chaos cultists achieve power through unspeakable methods, culminating—if they survive—in the shedding of their few remnants of humanity at the very end of their training. The older members of their circles are charged with the burden of knowledge that could even destroy the Empire’s own hierarchy; thus, they vow to end their very lives to keep the forbidden arts of Chaos away from their enemies’ reach."
