    description={AE_EOC_UNIT_NOTICE}+"Frequently considered lesser relatives of demons, the Imps are often underestimated due to their small size and lack of intellect. It is noteworthy, however, that a swarm of them is not a threat to ignore, even for an experienced soldier. They are mainly used by demonic attack forces as cannon-fodder to distract the enemy while the battle lords prepare the actual strike. However, it is rumored that some of these imps have grown bigger and stronger, enough to be a real strike force by themselves, which automatically promotes them to a higher level in the military ranks of Chaos."
