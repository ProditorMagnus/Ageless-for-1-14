    description={AE_EE_UNIT_NOTICE}+ _ "Sword Drakes are drake warriors of the fighter caste who have taken a different path from that of the Warriors. They eschew the traditional drakish war blade in favor of a slightly lighter sword. A sword is not as hard-hitting as a war blade, so they deal less damage, but they consider this tradeoff justified because they can strike more often. Drakes using this fight style are slower but toughter as well they have focused more in melee training and less at fire breath. By design drakish swords can also be used as blunt weapons without breaking even if you are as strong as a drake."
