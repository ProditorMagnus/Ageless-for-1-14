    description= _ "This unit is from Extended Era. Its coding and art were done by the Various people who created Extended Era.

Some nagas, whether through cowardice or cunning, develop a knack for surviving in darker depths of the water. After special training, this knowledge can develop into an entirely different branch of combat, although it is just as deadly. Naga Depthstalkers are especially valued as brood guardians, where they keep watch over eggs laid in hidden caves."
