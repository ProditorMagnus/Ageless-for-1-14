    description= _ "This unit is from Extended Era. Its coding and art were done by the Various people who created Extended Era.
 
Drenched in the blood of its enemies, an abomination bears little resemblance to the mutation it was created from. Enemy generals have been known to order full blown retreats at the mere sight of such a monster. An abomination's giant pus-laden body can withstand a dizzying amount of punishment, making it almost impossible to take down. This, combined with incredible raw strength, has turned abominations into veritable killing machines, something their chaos masters delight in."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_REGENERATES}
