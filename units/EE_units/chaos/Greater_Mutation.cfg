    description= _ "This unit is from Extended Era. Its coding and art were done by the Various people who created Extended Era.
 
It came as a great surprise to the Magus who created them that Mutations would over time increase in both stature and strength. It seems the act of killing feeds these bloodthirsty beasts on some innate level. There are few soldier's brave or indeed foolish enough to face off against such a creature, especially when night falls."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_REGENERATES}
