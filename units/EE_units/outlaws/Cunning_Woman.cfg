    description=_"This unit is from the Golden Age. Its coding and art where done by ForestDragon.

"+_"Sometimes even in marginality places there are people with talents in magic. Usually men living in corrupt ambients have no time to even notice if they had potential to magics, so some of those outlaw men could have talents for magic, but sadly they will never have time to wonder if they had or not talent for magics. Unlike in the case of men, women doesn't have that physical strength so many of them while childhood experimented a lot of different things... also for the surprise of some of these women they have talent for magic arts. Usually outlaws steal a lot of things, some of those magical books that almost nobody uses at all, also few cunning women autodidacts themselves in order to learn how to heal their wounded outlaw companions. Once they gain enough experience their foes' names them Outlaw Witches and when they start being feared by the enemies who face them they are named as Archwithches."
