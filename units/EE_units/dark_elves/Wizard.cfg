    description= _ "This unit is from Extended Era. Its coding and art were done by the Various people who created Extended Era.
 
Some Dark Elves prefer studying the arcane arts over close-combat. Usually they are left to the lesser duties of the House, such as upkeep, watching the slaves, and other such things. However, in time of conflict, they can do great damage, even though they lack any training in close-combat."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
