    description={AE_EE_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"When in his castle, the High Lord watches his slaves, feeds the lizards, and other duties. They wear simple purple robes, and keep their hair combed. However, when on the battlefield, they are as bold and daring as anyone. After years of experience, they know every trick of their trade. Their men follow them fearlessly, confident that through their Lords guidance, none can stand before them."
