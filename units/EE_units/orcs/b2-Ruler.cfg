" + _ "Any orc who can keep a large tribe from feuding and in-fighting is often unusually intelligent and commanding, and is inevitably very strong as well. They are skilled with both sword and crossbow, but their real talent lies in their rare ability to rally other orcs to battle, to give orders that are followed not out of fear, but loyalty."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_LEADERSHIP}
