If he is also strong and cunning enough to survive early leadership struggles, he will inevitably find himself leading a great horde of warriors, and he will also inevitably cause a great deal of trouble for the civilized races of the world. The surest way to disperse such a host is to slay this rare orc who can hold it together."
