    description= {AE_MONSTERS_UNIT_NOTICE}+_"Scholars differ as to the ancestry of the Water Serpent. Some hold that they are the immature young, or mature cousins, of Sea Serpents. Others hold them up as a primitive offshoot of the Nagas. What is certain is that it is wise to avoid waters where they are known to congregate."
