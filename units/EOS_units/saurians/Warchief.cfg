    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.
 
Lacking military training or discipline, the rare ocassions when saurians choose to fight a pitched battle tend to be savage and frenzied affairs. Left to their own devices the saurians' battle lines rapidly devolve into a number of individual melees. Here distinction is earned not through leadership or tactical ability, but sheer strength and fierceness, and the saurians' war chiefs earn their positions through feats of personal prowess rather than any sort of command ability. Although this leaves saurian warbands deficient tactically, the power and ferociousness of their champions is not to be underestimated."
