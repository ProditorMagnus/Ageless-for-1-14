Unlike the rousers, savages have decided to take on a reputation of fear rathern than leadership. The reason savages are dreaded is because it appears that savages have reverted to their primal instincts which are absolutely terrifying in the eyes of those who do not know about the minotaurs well. These frightening aspects appear to affect the enemy in a negative manner which will actually physically weaken them."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DIVINE_HEALTH}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_DREAD}
