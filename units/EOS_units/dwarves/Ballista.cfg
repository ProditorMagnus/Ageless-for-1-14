    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.
 
" + _ "The ultimate crossbow, a ballista is almost guaranteed to kill anything that is hit by one of its massive bolts. It is a large and cumbersome weapon, but dwarves somehow manage to move it over mountains and even through caves.

The operators of ballistae like to tinker with their machines, which has a wide variety of results."
