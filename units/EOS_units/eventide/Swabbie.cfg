    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.
 
All members of the Eventide whose profession involves ships learn to swim very well at a young age. In times of war, their swimming ability is often put to the test. Although they feel comfortable on land, no Swabbie ever truly feels at home when not near the water."
