    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.

These ruthless warriors harken back to the terrible reign of the Noct overlords, brutal nobles who used threats of punishments so terrible that their armies would rather run headlong into combat than face their masters. While this terrible method of invigorating troops has long been discarded by the eventide, the reputation of a Noct Maceman has not. "
