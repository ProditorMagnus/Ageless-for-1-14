    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.

When an Herbalist has proven his loyalty to the Eventide, his superiors will offer to teach him the prized secret of the Alchemist's guild, how to make 'palmfire.' This potent substance can be spread across any weapon that will not melt or burn, immediately setting aflame when it is struck soundly.

Alchemists find themselves able to use this newfound weapon to great effect.
