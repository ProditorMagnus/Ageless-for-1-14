When faced with foes who have similarly eliminated their fear of both day and night, the Eventide do not balk at using other means to achieve their goal of complete conquest. From deep within (their cities), men and woman from less scruptulous professions are enlisted, their ability with blades and their knowledge of poison highly regarded in military use. "
