    description= _ "This unit is from The Era of Strife. Its coding and art were done by Jami, AI, Elrias, Lizard, Quietus, Espreon, Neorice and Various others.

The Gnoll Sharpeyes have perfected their grand art of archery and have become somewhat adept in the use of thier swords. Eventhough most of the Gnolls spend most of their time attacking in the swamps the Sharpeyes sometimes participate in battle outside of the swamps. Nonetheless, these creatures take pride in their art, especially when using it to kill."
