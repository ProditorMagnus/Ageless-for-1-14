    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Horses are hard to come by in Marauder culture, and are also hard to take along on ocean raids across Iceswept Bay. Still, any Marauder would leap at the chance to steal horse or livestock, even if only for the journey back. All of the negative aspects of riding a horse into battle are forgotten once a Marauder makes the first quick and powerful axe-sweep cutting down an enemy, especially if the very horse he is riding was stolen from the man he slays."
