    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

There are few Marauders indeed that are of such skill that they receive the title Lord. A Marauder Lord is the strongest amongst his kin, and his fighting skills are constantly tested as many Marauders challenge his status as supreme champion of his tribe. His heroic deeds and charisma inspires other Marauders to fight harder for their tribe, and to battle until the death. Many 'civilized' generals have underestimated the Marauder Lord's wits and tactics, and paid for their mistake with their lives."
