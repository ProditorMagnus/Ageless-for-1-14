    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Bowriders come from the western part of Arendia. There they are the hunters, as a horse is the only thing which can keep up with prey in the savanna that covers the area. This means that they have had great practice firing bows from horseback. This experience makes them an invaluable part of Arendias army, where they use hit and run tactics to weaken the enemy and constantly harry their flanks."
