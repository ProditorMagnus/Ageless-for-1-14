Bowmasters are in many places the true lords of western Arendia, for all the bowknights answer to them, to whom the bowriders answer in turn. This means that, while the great plains of the west often seem ripe for conquest, if any force tried to invade those lands, they would soon face a sizable army of mounted archers who could lead the invaders on an exhausting goose-chase before wheeling around and peppering the enemy with arrows. This tactic quickly convinces all but the most determined foe that conquering western Arendia is not worth the trouble, and so normally the only trouble the western Arendians have is with internal banditry."
