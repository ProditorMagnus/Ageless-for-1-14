    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The name 'Arrow Wind' comes from an old folk tale in which the most skilled archer in all of Arendia was challenged to prove his prowess by firing arrows repeatedly in an outline around his his wife, and yet not kill her. When asked about this later, the wife likened the experience to a gentle breeze.

Nowadays the appelation has come to refer to the sound of their arrows. Capable of putting three arrows in the air before the first has hit the target, the sound of so many arrows in flight is likened to a rushing wind of death over the battlefield."
