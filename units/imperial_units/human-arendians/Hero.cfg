    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Once a wanderer has regained his honour he has usually done enough for the good of the people of Arendia that he is regarded as a hero by those who once scorned him. These men have fought in many a battle and usually this experience is put to good use by a clan in the area, or as bodyguards to the royal family. Heros are also regarded as the only people skillful enough to wield double bladed swords. These agile weapons are the most deadly and sharp in all of Arendia, forged by royal smiths in the forges of the capital."
