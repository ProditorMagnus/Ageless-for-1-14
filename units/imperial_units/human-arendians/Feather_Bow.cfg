    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
A result of a rigorous selection process, the Feather Bows are among the best archers in all the land. They gain their name from the tassel of feathers tied to the upper and lower parts of their bowstring, a combination of a badge of office and a silencing device for the bowstring. It is also said that when they fire, the sound is like that of a feather falling... until the arrow strikes home. Different clans use feathers colored with different dyes."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
