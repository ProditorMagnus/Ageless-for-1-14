The horsemen of western Arendia band into clans comprised for the most part of extended families, and the chieftain of a clan is usually the eldest fit male. The clan chief does not wield all the power, for the bowriders, who band together, comprise half of the clan's military might, but his influence should not be underestimated."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_RALLY}
