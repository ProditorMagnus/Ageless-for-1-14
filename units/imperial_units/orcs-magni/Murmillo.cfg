Members of the Galaladz tribe were known for recklessly charging into battle without regard for their own safety. Even in captivity, many of them maintained this tradition in the Lavinian arenas, which delighted the bloodthirsty crowds to no end. Such a warrior became known as a Murmillo."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_CHARGE}
