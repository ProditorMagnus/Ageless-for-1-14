    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

A Provocator may not be quite as heavily equipped as a Hoplomachus, but he more than makes up for it with his skill at swordsmanship, a skill over which it is not uncommon for Lavinian commoners to unabashedly fawn."
