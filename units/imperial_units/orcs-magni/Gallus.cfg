    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The first Galli were member of the Galaladz tribe, sworn enemies of the Samandiz. The Lavinians changed the pronunciation to suit their tastes and changed the meaning to refer to any low-level gladiator that used the long sword, a novel weapon to the fickle crowds, though traditional to the Galaladz."
