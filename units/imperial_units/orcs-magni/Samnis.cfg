One of the original types of Orcish gladiators, the first Samnes were members of the Samandiz tribe. The Lavinians changed the pronunciation to suit their tastes and changed the meaning to refer to any low-level gladiator that used the short sword, which was not a native Orcish weapon but rather a Lavinian one to which the Orcs were forced to adjust."
