    description= _ "This race is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The people of the southern hills and plains, united by Maximus the Imperator, have become the Lavinian Empire. Ruled with an iron fist, but governed in large part by the Senate, it seeks dominion over all the known world. They learned metalworking from the Dvergken, philosophy from the Dardanoi, and tactics from the Airiya. In open grassland, the terrain of their homeland, they are nearly unstoppable."
