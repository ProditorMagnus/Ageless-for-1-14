    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Though the seals are only animals, they learn from combat just as quickly as men, if not quicker, and soon after their first battle they have adjusted to the switch from hunting unarmed fish to attacking men armed with spear, sword and bow. Their elven masters are pleased with this, and reward them well, if they survive."
