    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Trained seals are an important part of the military, as they enable these Elves to control the seas. The use of aquatic allies is also helpful in the hunt, as it provides the Issaelfr with wider access to the bounty of the seas."
