    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The wild elf Furies do not wield an extraordinarily powerful weapon, but they are dangerous nonetheless, for they fight as if fey, and will press the battle long past when any reasonable man would have pulled back. Their madness often leads to their death, but even more often it will lead to the death of the enemy."
