    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Some men accuse the Shadowdancers of the use of dark magic, and many would believe it, for their ability to slip behind enemy lines and stab the foe in the back is truly uncanny. Most of them deny any magical knowledge whatsoever - a wise move, for in the Sidhe lands magic is reserved to the Raindancer class - but some defy the Council and proudly admit to the use of what they call a 'natural fey power for cunning and deception'. It is not dark magic, they say, but the use of the faerie talents they naturally possess. The Council, with most of its members afraid of a Shadowdancer blade finding them in their sleep, does nothing about this blatant disregard for its authority."
