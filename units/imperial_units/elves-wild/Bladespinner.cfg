    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Many men of the southern plains believed the tales of elven warriors who danced with their blades were just that - tales. The Marauders, however, knew all too well of the reality of the Bladespinners, whose swords would spin in dizzying patterns, deflecting the much heavier human swords with ease, and then cut the enemy in three places seemingly simultaneously, though the Bladespinners wield only two blades."
