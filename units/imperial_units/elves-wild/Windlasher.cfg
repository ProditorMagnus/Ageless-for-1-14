    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Those Raindancers who wish to focus all of their energy on the study of magic must follow the path of the Windlasher. They do not have the master-student relationship of the Thunderblades, for magic, the Sidhe believe, is best learned alone. A Windlasher, who has aleady learned the fundamentals of their art from the school at Mount Stormkeep, will continue his studies in isolation - even if he continues living in the city at Stormkeep, he will spend most of his days locked in his garden deep in contemplation."
