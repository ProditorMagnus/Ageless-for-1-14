A Stormlord has spent his entire life studying magic. He has sacrificed all else for this goal - including his skill with the sword. In exchange he has reached the absolute pinnacle of magical power. He can go no higher, for there is nowhere higher to go. He knows, it is said, all there is to know, about air, water, fire and earth. It is a shame that his wisdom manifests itself on the battlefield only as a massive thunderous display of raw power - but it is fitting, for it is the beauty seen in the power of the storm that inspired him to study magic in the first place."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
