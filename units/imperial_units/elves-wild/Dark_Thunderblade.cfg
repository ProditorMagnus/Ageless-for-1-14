    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
When Vaniyera the Shadowdancer took up the thunderblade of the west after the death of Leithan, he brought together a dancer's capacity for cunning and deception with the pure fey power of the storm. His possession of both of these styles of magic meant that, though his title was that of Thunderblade, his powers were unlike those of any other Sidhe."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BACKSTAB}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
