    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The Sidhe nobility do not lightly accept the fact that some among their subjects seek to join the ranks of the mages, but they are pragmatic and acknowledge that even weak ice magic is a useful supplement to their own skills, as long as its practitioners remember their place. Therefore, they have established the rank of Snowdancer as a reward for Hoarfrosters who excel in both skill and loyalty."
