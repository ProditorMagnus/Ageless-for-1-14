    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The speed and furocity of a Wild Elf Whirlwind is unmatched by any other warrior. He throws himself into battle, slashing his sword, up and down, left and right, in a cyclone of destruction, and refuses to pull back until he is physically unable to continue fighting."
