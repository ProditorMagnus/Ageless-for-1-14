The Wild Elves consider themselves an honorable people, and so the Veiledblades are always tolerated rather uneasily - they are, it is thought, merely ignoble assassins. This dislike continues up until the Veiledblades are needed in battle, at which point the Sidhe proclaim that deception is a natural part of war, and that Veiledblades are not assassins, but rather skirmishers, a quite noble profession."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_BACKSTAB}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
