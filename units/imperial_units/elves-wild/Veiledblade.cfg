    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The Wild Elves consider themselves an honorable people, and so the Veiledblades are always tolerated rather uneasily - they are, it is thought, merely ignoble assassins. This dislike continues up until the Veiledblades are needed in battle, at which point the Sidhe proclaim that deception is a natural part of war, and that Veiledblades are not assassins, but rather skirmishers, a quite noble profession."
