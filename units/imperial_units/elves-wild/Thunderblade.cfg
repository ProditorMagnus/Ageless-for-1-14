    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

When Vanimaro, the first King of the Sidhe, died in battle, the shards of his mighty sword were collected and kept preciously by the greatest wild elf mages. Twelve great Thunderblades were then made, each containing a shard of the original, and each containing a part of the power of the storm wielded by Vanimaro. These blades were awarded to the best of the swordsmen found among the Sidhe, and they were given rule over the various marches of the Sidhe forests and over the armies of those marches."
