Few Sidhe are capable of staying away from battle for long. The War Mages are wild elf nobility who, though trained as mages, spend most of their time with sword in hand. Their prowess with the sword easily equals that of a warrior, and their magic is a welcome ally."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MAGICAL}
