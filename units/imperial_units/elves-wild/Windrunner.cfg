A tale floats around the swamps of Marauderdom involving a Wild Elf Windrunner and the high queen of the Issaelfr. The Windrunner, who in the course of his wanderings found himself in Alfenheim, challenged the queen, a Mistral Rime Castellan, to a race. The winds which the Castellan carried in her pouch would be unleashed and sent against him, and if they caught him, he would tell the queen how to counter the poison found on the spears of the Windrunners. If he managed to outrun them, the queen would grant him an unnamed favor. The sidhe lost his brash wager, and that is how the Rime Castellans learnt the art of curing poison.

One version says that, anyway. Those who have seen the Windrunners in action doubt the purported outcome of the race."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}+" Their primary spear they coat with the sap of a certain shrub, giving it a poisonous tinge, but they would consider it cowardly to do this for their javelins as well."+{SPECIAL_NOTES_POISON}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
