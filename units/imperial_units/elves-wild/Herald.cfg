    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The Sidhe do not fight with any battle formation; each elf is left to his own devices to slay as many of the foe as possible. Nevertheless, though they fight independently, they do not ignore each other during the battle. The Herald is a perfect example of this. When not fighting himself, he will sing out a war chant, and those other elves who are fighting will listen to it and let the music guide them, inspiring them on to great deeds."
