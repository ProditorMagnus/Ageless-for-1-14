    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

A normal elf lives for thousands of years; one who decides to take the path of a Wildblade has decided that this is too long. Better a short and glorious life of battle, they say, than a death in old age. This conviction lends the Wildblades a courage, some would say recklessness, in battle that is unmatched. The lifespan of a Wildblade is short, for an elf, but those of his enemies are shorter."
