    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

When the elves settled in Alfenheim, they had never been a horse-riding people - the Sidhe never adopted mounts - and so it was not with the aim of finding a substitute for the no longer useful horse that the Issaelfr tamed the wild yak. It was because the northernmost settlements of the Issaelfr could not be supplied without a beast of burden of some kind. The Issaelfr soon learned of the usefulness of mounts in battle as well, and eventually the elves were experts at the use of this nontraditional cavalry."
