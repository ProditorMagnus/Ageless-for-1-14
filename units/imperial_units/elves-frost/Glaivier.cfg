    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

Not all Bladesmen are alike. Some choose the path of the solitary ice roamer, but many others prefer to fight in an organized fashion, lining up on the field of battle with other likeminded elves against whatever enemy. These elves quickly see the usefulness of the glaive, for it can act both as a spear and sword, and so the Issaelfr army does not need to train and equip a separate group of spearmen - the glavier can fight in the ranks alongside bladesmen, then when a spear is needed, they simply use their weapon differently. This great benefit is more than worth the slight inconvenience of learning a new weapon."
