    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The most elegant of Bladesmen become Ice Roamers, and perfect the skill of fighting upon frozen water with the speed of one fighting on land - and have learned to move and fight on land faster than one would think possible. They fight alone, and often make their way through enemy lines to strike at the opponent's rear to break a hole for their slower allies to take advantage of."
