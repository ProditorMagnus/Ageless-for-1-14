    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
It is said that, in the far north where the Issaelfr live, lamps dance in the sky during winter nights, making night almost as bright as day, but not with the light of the sun - it is a fey, mystical glow. Some think these lights are magic, and it is from them that the northern elves draw their magic. Whether or not this is true, the greatest Issaelfr archers are named for them, and a Borealis does seem to hit his target more often than is really natural."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}
