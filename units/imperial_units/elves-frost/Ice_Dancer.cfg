    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The Issaelfr and Sidhe have many things in common, and among them is a love for elegance. The Ice Dancer, like so many of his Sidhe brethren, makes swordsmanship a thing of beauty. The Dancers, though, tend to be rather aloof from Issaelfr society, and sometimes one wonders whether these elves would not have preferred to live in the groves of Mount Stormkeep rather than in the frigid wastes of the northern peninsula.

This wonder, however, is quickly erased when one sees with what grace they glide across the ice and snow found only in their adopted homeland."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_SKIRMISHER}
