    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
It's rare to see bears motivated enough to enter a fight in a meaningful way. Nevertheless, occasionally one of these enormous beasts will find some motivation, whether it be danger to its territory, desperation for food, or even through service to an ally. Even a juvenile bear is a fearsome sight on the battlefield, rending and tearing with its claws and crushing with its powerful limbs and sheer mass. Its heavy fur, thick skin, and already impressive bulk defy its surprising agility in the forest."
