Adult bears are known for going their own way; most bears would sooner flee a melee than throw themselves at risk. Some, though, for whatever reason, choose not to run. These bears are a terrifying sight to behold. An adult bear is a mass of muscle, claw, fur, and fury of almost unrivalled proportions: even the most skilled of warriors will not look lightly on the bulk of an angry, advancing bear."
