    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
The Rorarius is as good a melee fighter as almost any member of the Legion proper, simply because his lightweight shield and lack of armor allows him to make much stronger stabs with his gladius. However, this offensive capability comes at a price; although he deals more damage than even a Praetorian, he takes more in return, and is unable to retaliate at all against enemy archers. Rorarii are indeed powerful fighters, but they are only support troops, and without either Legionaires or other Auxilia they are ineffective against most armies."
