    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Much of Lavinian military strategy was determined by the need, early in their history, to capture the fortified cities that first opposed the rise of the Empire. These towns could not be taken by marching Legionaires, and so the Lavinians were forced to learn the art of the siege. Most important for a successful siege was the use of ballistae and catapults, but second only to that was the use of the Siege Archer. These bowmen did not shoot masses of arrows into the opposing town, but rather, hiding behind massive shields that acted as mobile ramparts, would carefully pick off enemy soldiers, slowly but surely, until the enemy garrison was depleted and the walls could be taken unopposed."+{SPECIAL_NOTES}+{SPECIAL_NOTES_MARKSMAN}+"The Siege Archer is so well armored that when he is defending, he will take reduced damage from physical weapons." #wmllint: ignore
