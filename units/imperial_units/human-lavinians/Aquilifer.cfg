    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.
 
Having a lion-skin headdress on his head, a golden eagle at the top of his standard, and the red-and-gold of the Legion on his armor, the Aquilifer truly is a symbol of the Empire itself. There is only one Aquilifer in each legion, and he must be a bold, courageous and wise man to hold that post. By carrying the Legion's Eagle, he makes himself a target for any enemy, and often must fight, and die, protecting it. The Eagle serves as inspiration and an object of honor for all of the Legionaires, and it will give them strength in the battle even in the dead of night." #wmllint: ignore
