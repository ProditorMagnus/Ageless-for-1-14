    description= _ "This unit is from Imperial Era. Its coding and art were done by Turin and Various others.

The Praetorian Guard's task is to protect the Imperator and his family - or simply whomever his employer is. Having been chosen from the rank and file of the Legion, he now occupies an extremely prestigious position, that of Imperial Bodyguard. His shield, large enough to protect both him and his charge, he can also use to stun his opponent, and perhaps kill him. In addition to this shield, he bears two throwing spears and a short sword. The shield of the Praetorian Guard is so large that it is easiest for him to retaliate to melee attacks with it, rather than switching to his gladius."
