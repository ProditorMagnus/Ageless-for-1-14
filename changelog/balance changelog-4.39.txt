AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases...)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.


FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
2) 4.39 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.


Featured Notes
- Shield attacks containing ONE SINGLE STRIKE that +slows will now have +Resistant(1) so the unit takes one less dmg per strike even if they miss the strike
Few other exceptions get split in two strikes but no other specials.

Considering the heck lot of XP you spent to gain him, Elite Sorcerer is specifically better for this purpose.

They seem bit weaker in fighgters and physical archers than all other AOA faction, but Mauve islands have slowers

Tomb line now correctly includes in price if they use embalm succesfully 
They seem me alright, including the embalm stat, so they have massive -15% on arcane.


Archaic - Primeval
I have to admit, my balance changes with the XP's had a sense still in 1.18 default increased swordsmen XP way too much...
Have now to deal with primeval units being elististic units with high XP to advance, SUPERIOR HP but very expensive to level up.
Want to adjust their arcane weakness to only -10% on ALL primevals. 
This is literally a big rework on the faction in how it works.

By design, they will have strong mid game but very slow transition to late and endgame.
