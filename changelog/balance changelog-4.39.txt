AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases...)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.


FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
2) 4.39 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.


Featured Notes
- Shield attacks containing ONE SINGLE STRIKE that +slows will now have +Resistant(1) so the unit takes one less dmg per strike even if they miss the strike
Few other exceptions get split in two strikes but no other specials.

Considering the heck lot of XP you spent to gain him, Elite Sorcerer is specifically better for this purpose.

They seem bit weaker in fighgters and physical archers than all other AOA faction, but Mauve islands have slowers

Tomb line now correctly includes in price if they use embalm succesfully 
They seem me alright, including the embalm stat, so they have massive -15% on arcane.


Archaic - Primeval
I have to admit, my balance changes with the XP's had a sense still in 1.18 default increased swordsmen XP way too much...
Have now to deal with primeval units being elististic units with high XP to advance, SUPERIOR HP but very expensive to level up.
Want to adjust their arcane weakness to only -10% on ALL primevals. 
This is literally a big rework on the faction in how it works.

By design, they will have strong mid game but very slow transition to late and endgame.

AE - Deep Elves
This is a complete rework, making them more viable in most situations.
- AE_dep_deep mountains defense to 50% (+10%)

- Minotaur HP to 60 (+8)
Let's just say, it's a lv2 unit with lv1 damges, lv2 HP, Lithic idol also being a disadventage. Needs to be tankier.

- Tyr'hai Rider HP to 42 (+5) , XP to 48 (+8) , cave/castle/village defense decrease by 10% , price to 21g (+2g)
- Tyr'hai Cavalry HP to 60 (+6) , impact damage to 10-2 (+1) , cave/castle/village decrease by 10% , price to 40g (+4g)

Transformed her into a more ranged unit, because faction lacks of pierce ranged, and this is quite more usefu, particularly the most if as an optional advancement.
- Night Stalker XP to 84 (+12) , price to 31g (+3g)
- Baroness of the Night HP to 63 (+8) , cold res to 20% (+10%%) , flat defense to 50% (+10%) , price to 61g (+7g)

- Stormblade HP to 73 (+7) , ranged damage to 10-2 (+1) , price to 64g (+7g)
- Raider HP to 37 (+1) , XP to 48 (+8)
Unit itself was fine, but problem is that knight advancement is quite too strong for just 40 XP, and the other option is not at its level.
- Pillager HP to 55 (+2) , movement to 10 (+1) , all strikes increase by 1 , price to 43g (+13g)
- Knight HP to 60 (+2) , arcane res to 10% (-10%) 
Comes from a unit that just costs 18g and 6 less XP than Loy horseman, so it's fine
- Cavalier arcane res to 10% (-10%) , price to 85g (+15g)
- Assault Drone melee adjusted to 9-2 (from 6-3) , XP to 82 (-5)
Can't make it so much better than Sentry Drone because it comes from same unit... forced to make this unit probably much worse than what I would want...

- Sentry Drone XP to 72 (-5)
- Enforcer Drone blade melee adjusted to 10-4 (from 8-5) , price to 55g (+3g)


EFM - Whites
Some underpowered that is about to be fixed.

- Terror Rider HP to 37 (+1) , XP to 43 (-5)

Who cares about more health, this unit is just quite underpowered.
- Warder HP to 37 (+1) , XP to 34 (-3) , price to 12g (-1g)
- Guardian HP to 55 (+5)
- Sentinal HP to 68 (+5)
There was a need to make this unit so terrible? another buff from another review...
- Scout HP to 31 (+1) , XP to 34 (-2)
- Raider ranged damage to 8-3 (+1)
It has no lv3 ...
- Bowlady price to 56g (+3g)
- Storm Witch price to 37g (+3g)
- Storm Lady XP to 150 (+16) , price to 66g (+4g)
The only nerf... but considering the buffs on the bad units might be a WIN for the faction.


EFM - Pygmies
- AE_efm_pygmies_spiderfoot cold res to 10% (+10%) , fire res to -20% (+10%)
- AE_efm_pygmies_crocfloat cold res to -10% (+20%)
Is there a need to make this foottypes be so bad vs magic?
Cold becoming more common and in higher values, requires this units to get buffed to it.

- Puma XP to 34 (-2) 
- Lynx HP to 44 (+2) , XP to 72 (+5)

This will make AI quite more useful when using this unit...
- Shifter human form movement to 6 (+1) , XP to 45 (-5) 
- Wilderman human form movement to 6 (+1) , all charging animals damage increase by 1, wolf bite parry 5% , price to 33g (+3g)
Have not tested this unit so I'm not sure if he needs more HP but some animal forms were quite underpowered...

I rather Concotionist have better melee in modded gamemodes lol


ELE - Fallen
Realized that most of previous changes to fallen in 4.38 did not correctly implement... regards on this
The list might become quite long because it's both 4.38 and 4.39 balance changelog intentions.

- Enforcer XP to 37 (-3)
- Infiltrator ranged damage to 7-3 (+1) , arcane res to -10% (+10%)

- Inquisitor HP to 58 (+3) , melee damage to 10-2 (+2) , arcane res to -10% (+10%)
His aura is more often considered a bother than an help, so he as "bad teammate" by himself now has better stars.
- Knight blade damage to 15-2 (+1) , price to 46g (+6g)
- Lord HP to 65 (+2) , sword damage to 19-2 (+3) , fire res to -10% (+10%) , price to 67g (+9g)

ELE - Horned Skeletons
This faction is facting severe issues at having massive -40% on arcane and -10% arcane, still of having good units, they are poor in HPs.

- Horse Fighter HP to 51 (+3) , XP to 84 (+9)
- Horse Knight HP to 69 (+6) , blade attack now has +Dread special , pierce damage to 16-2 (+1) , price to 67g (+4g)

- Skeletal Mage Knight HP to 57 (+3) , fire/cold res increased by 10% , ranged damage to 9-3 (+1) , price to 66g (+9g)

- Lich Overlord HP to 72 (+4) , cold ranged damage to 14-3 (+1) , price to 103g (+10g)
Would buff it more.... but it has TWO different leadership skills, which is quite dangerous if combined.

- Corpse Burner HP to 42 (+2) , all damages increase by 1 , XP to 80 (+8)
- Corpse Inferno HP to 54 (+4) , melee damage to 11-2 (+1) , ranged damage to 13-3 (+2) , price to 58g (+3g)

- Sverd Skjold HP to 60 (+3) , movement to 6 (+1) , impact damage increase by 1 , ranged damage increase by 1 , price to 60g (+6g)
Been wrong that this unit been 5 movement unlike the other advancements, less tankier than the other Skjolds but stronger ranged.
All of them semi low HP and support aura purpose.
