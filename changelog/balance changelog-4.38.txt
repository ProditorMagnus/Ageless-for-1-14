AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases... will try to fix that in 4.37)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.


FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
2) 4.37 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.

- Harpy Messenge price to 44g (+9g)

AE - SteelHive
Steelhive will receive a rework, particularly drastically changing their gameplay.
Their main units will get nerf (oculus, rocketer) and slasher will get reworked to be more swift and less tanky.

All more secondary units will receive just buffs, rewarding players that uses them well.



- Rocketer HP to 31 (-1) , XP to 45 (+1) , price to 17g (+1g)
- Bombardier HP to 45 (-1) , price to 34g (+4g)
- Dreadnough price to 62g (+7g)
New unit is performing way too good... minor nerfs

- All Slasher and advancement cold res to 0% (+10%) -only zerker keeps cold weakness-
Just wanted to rework the lv1 slasher, so it has less inconsistencies with lv2 advancement.
Not as usual melee fighter that is for tankyness, slasher is swift, deadly but fragible.
Now is more cost efficient but weaker, but matches better with prices considering it has no traits.

- Vector HP to 51 (-2) , XP to 82 (+5) , price to 30g (+3g)
- Amniote fire & impact res to 0% (+10%)

- Mage-blade fire/cold res to 10% (+10%)
- Magistrer fire/cold res to 20% (+20%) , arcane res to 20% (+10%) , now has +Magic-counter in melee
Magistrer is now some kind of hybrid fighter mage with good magical resistance.
Considering he's swift foot, he's an extraordinary tank againist non magical fire/cold attackers.

- Warrior mage fire/cold res to 10% (-10%) , pierce res to 0% (-20%)
- Knight Arcanist fire/cold res to 10% (-10%) , pierce res to 0% (-20%)

- Mounted Bowman HP to 54 (+6) , price to 32g (+3g)
- Mounted Arhcer HP to 67 (+8) , price to 54g (+6g) , AMLA XP to 126 (-24)
So this option can be quite much more viable in comparation of the other

- Pluderer XP to 37 (-2)

- Guard XP to 40 (-5)
- Soldier XP to 77 (-6)
- Rampart melee damage to 11-3 (+1)
No damage, can't carry by himself

FL - Amazons

FL - Blood Elves
Blood Elves are being too strong in early game, but also quite weak in lategame. 
Let's adjust both aspects.


- Dark Crossbowman HP to 32 (-1) , price to 16g (+1g)
- Dark Marksman XP to 75 (+5)
- Ballistic Crossbowman melee damage to 5-3 (-1)
- Blood Hunter has no longer marksman in ranged
It has ressists, decent health, improved movement cost and defenses, high dmgs , doesn't need marksman ranged

- Phoenix hatching regenerates value from 2 to 3
This needs a severe buff becaue of nerfs in other units in this faction


- Dark Swordsman movement XP to 44 (+2) , price to 18g (+1g)
- Fire Warrior fire res to 60% (+20%) 
Basically 1/3 less fire damage taken if no modded.
- Grand Warrior / Blood Warrior fire res to 35% (+5%)
- Blood Warrior now regenerates 3

- Great Minotaur regenertes value from 4 to 5

- Black Lizard AMLA XP to 120 (-30)

- Assasin Master NEW ATTACK: Burning blade 8-5 fire melee (no specials, no features, JUST FIRE DAMAGE)
                 Now also regenerates 4
It's an interesting bonus to make the unit quite more unique. It can now either do 8-5 blade poison (no backstab) or instead do 8-5 fire damage no special on melee.
Which can be quite useful againist mechanical, undead and some other types of enemies.



EE - Dwarves
