AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases...)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.


FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
2) 4.37 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.

Just wanted to rework the lv1 slasher, so it has less inconsistencies with lv2 advancement.
Not as usual melee fighter that is for tankyness, slasher is swift, deadly but fragible.
Now is more cost efficient but weaker, but matches better with prices considering it has no traits.

- Vector HP to 51 (-2) , XP to 82 (+5) , price to 30g (+3g)

- Mage-blade fire/cold res to 10% (+10%)
- Magistrer fire/cold res to 20% (+20%) , arcane res to 20% (+10%) , now has +Magic-counter in melee
Magistrer is now some kind of hybrid fighter mage with good magical resistance.
Considering he's swift foot, he's an extraordinary tank againist non magical fire/cold attackers.

- Warrior mage fire/cold res to 10% (-10%) , pierce res to 0% (-20%)
- Knight Arcanist fire/cold res to 10% (-10%) , pierce res to 0% (-20%)

FL - Amazons
- Forest Ghost now regenerates 4 passively
- Dark Harpy XP to 80 (-4)

- Dark Marksman XP to 75 (+5)

This needs a severe buff becaue of nerfs in other units in this faction

It's an interesting bonus to make the unit quite more unique. It can now either do 8-5 blade poison (no backstab) or instead do 8-5 fire damage no special on melee.
Which can be quite useful againist mechanical, undead and some other types of enemies.



EE - Dwarves

The gain of stats is quite low in lv3 promotion, so it's why I add 50% flat defense on lv3
