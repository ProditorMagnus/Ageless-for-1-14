AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases... will try to fix that in 4.37)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
  1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
  2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.
 
  
FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
  1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
  2) 4.37 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.

AE - Dark Legion
While comparing to other Ageless factions, they look kinda boring, so I'm adding them stuf to make them more fun if got by random.

- Frost Fury Shooter HP to 55 (+3) , cold ranged damage to 14-3 (+2) and is now +Magical , pierce attack adjusted to 12-4 and no specials , price to 56g (+2g)
- Flying Golem cold res to 30% (+10%)
- Frost Gunner cold res to 40% (+20%)
They're made of "cold minerals" , why so low cold res?
- Frost Gunner Master HP to 57 (+2), cold ranged damage to 15-2 (-1) and now has +Marskman special

Considering almost the entire faction is weak to arcane/fire , enemies that would be weak to them can no longer hide from cold damage.


AE - Yokai
- Poltergeis XP to 38 (-8)
- Banshee melee to 4-2 (+1)
- Medusa Witch melee to 6-2 (+1)
- Slurger Swarm minimun strikes decrese to 2 (-1)
- Moving Fortress ranged minimun strikes decrease to 1 (-2)
This is to prevent powerufl plague army cheese.

Main issue in yokai as said is the lack of lv2-lv3 in some lines, needs new units to entirely fix the faction.


EOC - Wild Humans
- Crossbowman HP to 55 (+5)
- Forester HP to 52 (+4)
They can't lv3 , they need to be slightly OP.


ELE - Fallen 
Minor buffs

- Fallen Infiltrator ranged damage to 7-3 (+1)
- Fallen Liquidator HP to 57 (+2) , ranged damage to 9-3 (+1)

ELE - Horned Skeletons
- Lv2 and lv3 skeletons javelins are now a ranged attack instead of melee


EFM - Pygmies
They have so low HP in their lv3 units, which makes them to struggle when they have to hold positions.
- Fly HP to 31 (+1) , XP to 40 (-1)
- Charmer HP to 43 (+2)
- Saber Cat HP to 57 (+2)
- Lizard Eye HP to 62 (+2)
- Sorceress HP to 56 (+2)


EFM - Darklanders
- Judgement of gods HP to 64 (+4)

EFM - Dalefolk
- Rocketer XP to 30 (-4) , Artillery attack to 13-1 (+1) , price to 14g (-1g)
This unit is so TERRIBLE at lv1 and lv2 , while depending in hills or mountains to not be junk.
- Chaneller XP to 47 (-3)
- Mediator HP to 42 (+2) , XP to 95 (-5)
- Beacon HP to 46 (+2)

- Javelineer HP to 55 (-1) , melee damage to 9-2 (-2) , ranged now has +Bleeding , price to 22g (-3g)
- Harpooner melee damage to 13-2 (-2) , ranged damage to 17-2 (+1) and now has +Bleeding , price to 48g (-3g)

This change to Spearthowers increases the value of the unit in PVP helping againsit opponents that are camping, Still this decreases the dmg output of the unit.
Bleeding stops enemies from healing a turn or take 2 dmg (which can last hit kill) per turn.
Additionally less damage ranged spears decreases the advantage from camping.

- Serpent cold res to -20% (-10%) -too powerful-
- Thunder Serpent both attacks now have +Electric (1/3 movement slow only)

In overall it's worse than the other lv3 water snake.


EOS - Eltirians
- Bishop arcane slow damage to 10-2 (+1)
- Archbishop arcane slow damage to 15-2 (+2) , arcane ranged damage adjusted from 9-4 to 8-5
It unlike mage of light in default, has no illuminates aura, so he deserves bit more dmg, other reason is having worse melee.
