AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
PENDING, LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.
Idea is to be consistent in this thing in a future release (maybe in 4.37?)

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- SIMPLIFY THE UI in certain units (too many specials in certain specific cases... will try to fix that in 4.37)
- FEW new units in multiple factions
  1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
  2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
  
FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
  1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
  2) 4.37 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.
