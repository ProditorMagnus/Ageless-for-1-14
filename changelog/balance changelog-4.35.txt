AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Review in 1.18 EFM factions to adjust/modify arcane ressistance if needed.
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- FEW new units in multiple factions
  1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
  2) ARCHAIC - Menagerie - Technomancer (Lv3) (Mechanical melee fighter that becomes machine race, more melee, better physical res but big lose in ranged damage and dmg to arcane)
  It will feature advantages like poison/plague inmunity and can be repaired by machinists.
  3) ARCHAIC - Kthon - Argamarok (Lv3) (Planned to be a slower, less armored (but more HP) compared to Orthrus)
  Will keep ranged slows but with -10% accuracy & higher base damage (it can slow in retaliation, but unit should not be used for that in offensive)
  will probably have 50% marksman on melee.
  4) AE - Deep Elves - Corrupted (Will feature melee/ranged secret attacks , odd ressistances and no stardust bonuses)
  Deep Elves are actually blade/impact spam the most, few pierce is not enough, so they might need more attack types.
  5) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.

Feudal - High Elves
Arcane hits a lot stronger, high level shielders cannot be -20% on arcane because of the arcane rework...

- All archers arcane resistance to 0% (+10%)
- Gendarme HP to 66 (+3) , NEW ATTACK: 13-3 pierce melee (no charge) 
It now has the option of attacking with same damage but no charge special, as the unit gains very low stats on advancement.

What is intende is that players if looking for dmg's maintain lv2 from XP mod, unless they cannot do that and use the unit for its leadership to lower level ones.
The tankyness buff also helps kinda bit in late game in case there is no unit to apply leadership. 
- Fouchardier HP to 68 (+3) , it now has +Magic-Counter in melee , price to 60g (+6g)
