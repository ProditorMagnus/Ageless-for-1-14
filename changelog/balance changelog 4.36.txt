AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
LV2 NEW XP STANDARIZATIONS
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/200/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (90/100/111) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Review in 1.18 EFM factions to adjust/modify arcane ressistance if needed.
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- FEW new units in multiple factions
  1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
  2) ARCHAIC - Menagerie - Technomancer (Lv3) (Mechanical melee fighter that becomes machine race, more melee, better physical res but big lose in ranged damage and dmg to arcane)
  It will feature advantages like poison/plague inmunity and can be repaired by machinists.
  3) ARCHAIC - Kthon - Argamarok (Lv3) (Planned to be a slower, less armored (but more HP) compared to Orthrus)
  Will keep ranged slows but with -10% accuracy & higher base damage (it can slow in retaliation, but unit should not be used for that in offensive)
  will probably have 50% marksman on melee.
  4) AE - Deep Elves - Corrupted (Will feature melee/ranged secret attacks , odd ressistances and no stardust bonuses)
  Deep Elves are actually blade/impact spam the most, few pierce is not enough, so they might need more attack types.
  5) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
