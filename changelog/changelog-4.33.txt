PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Review in 1.18 EFM factions to adjust/modify arcane ressistance if needed.
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.

FL - ALTARIS
They struggle real lot in early game (as expected), but they have some decent early game options. Only issue is that players are forced to pick Lv2 Arcane Warrior as leader choice... because the other option as leaders aren't this very useful in early game...

Changes in Altaris Foot
- Human Altaris frozen defense will be increased to 40% (+20%) , movement cost to 2 (-1)
- Human Altaris mountain movement cost to 2 (-1)
Each change must come with cons, they dislike exotic terrains just a bit.
- Sand defense decrease to 20% (-10%)
- Mushroom Grove defense decrease to 40% (-10%)

Conjurer and advancement: They seem too fragible and actually a risky unit to go for. They needs buffs.
(This excludes ilusions)
- Added a description to units from this line
- Swallow / Swamp movement cost from 3 to 2
- Impact ressistance from 0% to 10%
  - Illusionist HP to 41 (+2) , flat defense to 50% (+10%) , sand defense to 30% (+10%)
  - Master of Illusion HP to 54 (+2) , now is 50% defense in the following terrains (flat, sand, frozen, fungus ; from worse to better) ; now is 40% defense in water tiles.
  - Illusion_Master_of_Illusion is now 50% (+10%) flat defense 
  
Pegassus opinion: scouts with both -20% on pierce and impact cannot work well, so they need something extra to deal with than just only terrible ressistances.
- Added a description to Pegasus & Pegasus Master.
- Pegassus arcane ressistance to 30% (+10%) , pierce resistance to -10% (+10%)
- Pegasus Master arcane resistance to 40% (+20%) , pierce resistance to -10% (+10%) , NEW ATTACK: 9-2 arcane +airbone +divine
