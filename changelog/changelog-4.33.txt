AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
- EOC - Quenoth Elves will officially be removed
AE - Desert Elves rework will fix this issue, we don't need repeated factions.
Idea is adding post 1.14 Quenoth Elves some time later, not in this release.

PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- Certain Free Saurian units adjusting manually to 10%
- Review in 1.18 EFM factions to adjust/modify arcane ressistance if needed.
- Adding the wanted AMLA for Altaris Scouts.
- FEW new units in multiple factions
  1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
  2) ARCHAIC - Menagerie - Technomancer (Lv3) (Mechanical melee fighter that becomes machine race, more melee, better physical res but big lose in ranged damage and dmg to arcane)
  It will feature advantages like poison/plague inmunity and can be repaired by machinists.
  3) ARCHAIC - Kthon - Argamarok (Lv3) (Planned to be a slower, less armored (but more HP) compared to Orthrus)
  Will keep ranged slows but with -10% accuracy & higher base damage (it can slow in retaliation, but unit should not be used for that in offensive)
  will probably have 50% marksman on melee.
  4) AE - Deep Elves - Corrupted (Will feature melee/ranged secret attacks , odd ressistances and no stardust bonuses)
  Deep Elves are actually blade/impact spam the most, few pierce is not enough, so they might need more attack types.
  5) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
  


FL - ALTARIS
They struggle real lot in early game (as expected), but they have some decent early game options. Only issue is that players are forced to pick Lv2 Arcane Warrior as leader choice... because the other option as leaders aren't this very useful in early game...

Changes in Altaris Foot
- Human Altaris frozen defense will be increased to 40% (+20%) , movement cost to 2 (-1)
- Human Altaris mountain movement cost to 2 (-1)
Each change must come with cons, they dislike exotic terrains just a bit.
- Sand defense decrease to 20% (-10%)
- Mushroom Grove defense decrease to 40% (-10%)

Conjurer and advancement: They seem too fragible and actually a risky unit to go for. They needs buffs.
(This excludes ilusions)
- Added a description to units from this line
- Swallow / Swamp movement cost from 3 to 2
- Impact ressistance from 0% to 10%
  - Illusionist HP to 41 (+2) , flat defense to 50% (+10%) , sand defense to 30% (+10%)
  - Master of Illusion HP to 54 (+2) , now is 50% defense in the following terrains (flat, sand, frozen, fungus ; from worse to better) ; now is 40% defense in water tiles.
  - Illusion_Master_of_Illusion is now 50% (+10%) flat defense 
  
Pegassus opinion: scouts with both -20% on pierce and impact cannot work well, so they need something extra to deal with than just only terrible ressistances.
- Added a description to Pegasus & Pegasus Master.
- Pegassus arcane ressistance to 30% (+10%) , pierce resistance to -10% (+10%)
- Pegasus Master arcane resistance to 40% (+20%) , pierce resistance to -10% (+10%) , NEW ATTACK: 9-2 arcane +airbone +divine
Their lances can now deal arcane damage if the enemy is undrainable OR a monster.

- Golem swamp & Swallow waters movement cost to 2 (-1)
- Quicksand golem arcane resistance to -20% (+10%) , 
- Stone Golem swamp & swallow waters movemetn cost to 2 (-1) , sand/frozen defense to 30% (+10%)
Will keep their increased arcane weakness because of giving them more terrain bonuses.
Heavier golems will maintain 3 MP cost in swamp/waters.
- Iron & Gold Golems castle defense to 50% (+10%)

- Primeval Warrior XP to 165 (-5)

- TrueHearted ranged damage increase to 8-3 , price to 66g (+1g)
- First Sword HP to 80 (+6) , price to 93g (+3g) , AMLA XP to 200 (-50)
Unit lacks of physical resistances which makes it bland, and because of higher XP spent for it.

- Lord of Earth HP to 46 (+1) , XP to 85 (-3)
- Stone Warrior XP to 84 (-4)

FL - BLOOD ELVES
I didn' imagine that rebels's buff in default was this insane, so blood elves need to be stronger as they don't have healers.
They do not have slowers as well...
- Ballistic Crossbowman HP to 55 (+2) , ranged will now have +Skilled instead of +Marksman , melee damage increase to 6-3 (+1) , price to 55g (+2g), AMLA XP to 134 (-16)

This might help a real lot in a faction that has no healers.
- Assasin NEW ATTACK: Knife 6-4 blade melee (no specials)
this allows them to be more deadly in defense and if strong to be 9-4 on night. Fair enough as default rogues have a ranged attack while this not.

- Conjurer HP to 42 (+1) , movement to 6 (+1)
- Quietus death wave attack damage increase to 36-1 (+1) , now has MERC's +triple-strike special and +Poison
36-1 cold secondary attack is not even the best single-strike attack in the era, it's same damage type than main attack, so it's a bad attack.
