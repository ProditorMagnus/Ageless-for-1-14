AE - GLOBAL MESSAGE
Same as of lv3 and lv4 having this tiers (126/134/150/166/175) for lv3 , (175/187/200/214/225/250) for lv2, there will be certain values for lv2.
- Lv2 values might be (85/90/100/111/125) depending out of unit's potential in late/endgame based in their stats and special qualities.
There will be exceptions.


PENDING, NOTED CHANGES
- FEW new units in multiple factions
1) AE - Desert Elves - Desert Warrior & its Lv3 (same 9-4 blade melee but 20% on blade/impact & 10% on pierce) , very XP thristy for lv3
2) Wanting to add something else in SteelHive, but no concept yet.
- REVAMPING animals & Monsters from different races (as well of wolves), as wolf is not exactly a monster, but will get idea that wolves get benefits from both animals and monster but wihtout the cons of monsters.
3) 

FACTIONS PENDING TO BE ADDED LATER:
1) Postponed UtbS Quenoth Elves in prior of decreasing the list of pending units that been so long ago.
2) 4.40 will add a EE - Rebels faction which was removed because being so mediocre add, but will make it somewhat decent in more recent times.
3) Will attempt to add some factions in 4.40's on this release.


4.40 ON GOING PLANS
- AMLA XP standarizations for lv2 and lv4 based in TIERing
(Consistency, Expected performance, Maximun Potential, Base Potential) , the better in overall more AMLA XP values.
In short, base health/toughtness, how well does the unit scale with external mod upgrades... etc

Lv2 will be tiering from AMLA XP of 80 (lowest tier animals...) to 125 (Mother Mudcrawler...)
Lv4 wil lbeb tiering at specific values: 175, 188 , 200, 214, 225, 233, 250


AE - Dark Legion

- Deathmaster price to 57g (+4g)
- Guardian Shield damage to 13-2 (+2) 
- Terror shield damage to 20-2 (+1)
- Crusher HP to 54 (+2)
We now standarize that this unit losses 5 dmg per stunning strike.


AE - Deep Elves
- Blood Seeker blade melee damage to 8-6 (-1) , flat defense to 45% (+5%)
Odd change, but unit has issues with health and too high damages...
- Tyr'hai Rider impact melee damage to 8-2 (+1)
- Tyr'hai Cavalry impact melee damage to 11-2 (+1) , AMLA XP to 90 (-10)
- Matriarch HP to 40 (+1)
- Vault Lurker will no longer have marksman on melee
It also might fix the issues of the unit being underpriced in golds
- Shadow Tyr'hai will now no longer telerport at lv1 priesstess , but instead on lv3 corrupted

AE - Desert Elves
- Desert Star AMLA XP to 188 (-12)
Unit can gain inteligent trait and be quite problematic if so... reason it's not in 175 tier.


AE - Frozen
- Frost Rider price to 21g (+3g)
It's quite slow, but impact charge is quite valuable attack. It also has an alright blade melee
Will instead make Ice Golem a more cost efficient tank unit
- Frost Knight price to 42g (+6g)
- Frost Fighter cold melee damage to 8-2 (+1) , XP to 44 (+4)
- Berserker Golem HP to 39 (+3) , Cold attack damage to 8-3 (+1) and now has +Berserk special , Cold res to 50% (+10%) , arcane res to -10% (+10%)
Considering attack's name it's weird it doesn't has berserk. Cool to give it more uniqueness with cold berserk.
It doesn't fit well the unit being "safe berserker" type
- Frost Gunner HP to 46 (+4) , price to 31g (+1g)
No trait bonus, low stats overall
- Frost Gunner Master cold res to 50% (+10%)
- Ice Golem HP to 45 (+4) , cold melee damage to 8-2 (+1) , XP to 45 (+2) , arcane res to -30% (-10%) , price to 19g (-2g)
Arcane weakness is just to make it fairer vs default undead.
- Big Ice Golem HP to 64 (+2)
- Ice Golem King impact melee damge to 21-2 (+1) , price to 60g (+5g)
Ice golems are low dmg overall...

- Frost Lanceman impact res to 0% (+10%)
- Frost Laance Master HP to 72 (+2) , impct res to 0% (+10%) , price to 54g (+2g)

It's among best healers for its costs, high dmg and heals+4 and moves 6
- Frost Sorceress arcane damage to 13-3 (+1)

Want to see this unit being deployed more often :)
- Steel Hive Queen HP to 67 (-3) , movement to 5 (-1)
Its level 2 only needs 55 XP to lv3 ... and leadership aura is quite valuable.
- Steel Hive Empress HP to 80 (-2) , blade damage to 16-2 (+1) , ranged damage to 11-3 (+1) , price to 100g (+7g)




AE - Yokai 
- Onyro AMLA XP to 111 (+11)
- Weaver Emress AMLA XP to 134 (+34)

If opposing side has no counter, this unit is nearly inmortal, XP increases because of 2 traits.
- Greater Spriggan XP to 77 (+5)

So the faction suffers less from WC II enemy woses


Archaic - Kthons

POST PONED TO 4.41 
As for new unit with new advancement and also becoming recruitable requires so much work.
Hopefully this will get released in February of 2026
- Artic Wolf REWORK !!
1) 4-3 cold melee , 4-3 cold ranged
2) Will now become recruitable!
3) Will advance to a Lv2 with same sprite but the blue ball in sprite
4) Might move 8 points, price will depend in its health, but will be signifncalty more costy than Timber Wolf
5) XP will depend in HP and cost
6) 1 Movement cost at frozen and forests, which will make it quite costy
7) 50% frozen defense and 30% cold res (will be required to tank DA if vs undead)

- NEW UNIT: Tundras Wolf
HP: 45
6-3 cold melee , 8-3 cold ranged +marksman
Movement: 9
No lv3
Frozen 60% defense , cold res 40%


Archaic - Menagerie
Mini rework, too cost efficient will get nerf. Other options will have slightly better cost efficiency.

- Blue Lizard melee damage to 6-3 (-1)
It also moves 6... too good...
- Azure Dragon AMLA XP to 214 (+14)
- Manbot melee damage to 4-2 (-1) , ranged to 6-1 (+2) , price to 10g (+2g)
Lunar Goo is very powerful unit from plague
- Cyborg will no longer have +backstab on melee , fire ranged damage to 12-1 (+1) , price to 19g (+3g)
It's easy to get for free from blue machinist kills. 
- Tower Madam ranged will now have +Harmless (attack deals always 0 dmg)
- Tower Captain HP to 56 (-2) , ranged damage to 8-2 (-1) , price to 29g (+1g)
Poison melee is quite an annoying feature to own, it also has fire ranged...

New units coming soon.... will let u know soon later :)


Archaic - Northern Orcs
- Vagrant will now have +Magic-Dodge bonus
- Traveler melee will now have +Magic-Counter bonus
Makes certain sense if we consider lv1 has magic ranged, so this melee unit is more aware of magic knowledge


Archaic - Phantom
- Stalker AMLA XP to 90 (-10)


Archaic - Primeval
- Sun Wheel AMLA XP to 188 (+13)
- Sun-Shield AMLA XP to 150 (+16)

- Line Breaker melee attack will no longer have rage(2) and damage to 15-3 (+1) , New attacK: 8-4 impact melee rage(3) +first-strike , price to 65g (-5g)
Main attack is too powerful particularly at lv2 to have rage(2) bonus and regen at same time.
Previously the unit had Aggresion which was also used in offensive, but back then Primeval had no consistent impact melee fighter, been my bad that this unit been THIS OP.


Archaic - South Seas
- Greater Albatros AMLA XP to 85 (-5)

EE - Outlaws
- Outlaw Queen AMLA XP to 134 (-16)
- Princess melee damge to 6-3 (from 7-2)
Wanted to do the cunning woman advancement to Outlaw Princess... but I better skip one release because of description issues.
- Raider ranged damage to 11-2 (-2) , price to 30g (+1g)
It no longer needs to be that strong as outlaws are now siginificantly stronger faction than before.
- Outlaws no longer recruiting default ogres because these can't lv3.
We don't need dupped ogres in outlaws

FL - Altaris
- Lv1 - Lv3 illusions arcane resistance to -200% (from -50%)
Idea is that holograms become a double edge weapon, not worthy for XP mod or HP training.
- Arcane Warrior XP to 100 (+10)
- Truehearted XP to 159 (+14)
They have really high HP and above average ranged, worth it.
- Ancient Warrior magic-counter will get replaced by a better version "special-counter"
The same, but it works over +precision melee at lowering its hit chance to 60% and magical/enchanted to 40%

4) Mountain movement cost to 1 (-1) , sand defense to 30% (+10%) , cave defense to 50% (+10%)
While testing him, he was surprisingly underwhelming.
I don't want him to be as tanky as EOMA Master of Earth because Land Mage has more ranged damage.


- Crystal Golem will now have +Magic-counter at both melee
It will be a valuable counter for magic-melee abusers (fire elemental, etc)


FL - Amazons

15-3 fire ranged +magical
18-2 impact ranged +magical
Res: Same as lv2, but 65% (+5%) on fire
XP: 120
Price: 60g

This level up is quite "bad" , but provides impact ranged, which is sometimes pretty useful vs units with high fire res.
"While promoting, Pyromancer finds capable to cast larger fireballs and can now cast meteor to their foes which while not as efficient as fireballs come very handy in certain situations."
